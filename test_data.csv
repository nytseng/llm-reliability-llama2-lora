52,L1c3-18_RCFinal proposal,"The car mass level we have decided is best for your roller coaster is 0.6 kg. This specific mass was chosen because based on the experiments we created. It has enough potential energy and kinetic energy. The initial drop/lift height level we chose which is 1 m. This specific initial drop/ lift height was chosen because if the height is less than or the same height as the hill height (.9-0 m) the car will either not be able to make it over the hill or it will have dangerous levels of speed. This obviously leaves 1 m the best initial drop height.

Also, the hill height will be important as well. The hill height we chose for your roller coaster is 0.6 m. This height was chosen because as stated before, if the initial drop height is the same as the hill height then the car won’t be able to make it over the hill. And we decided that if the hill height is only .2m less than the initial drop. This leaves .6 m the best choice.

57,L1c3-12_RCFinal proposal,"Our firm suggests to use the Car Mass of 0.4 kg. The reasoning behind our choice of Car Mass is the reasonable amount of Potential Energy (pe). The more mass the more PE. For example, a 0.4 kg mass resulted in 3.9 J of pe. A greater Car Mass of 0.8 kg resulted in 7.8 J of pe. Compared to the lowest Car Mass of 0.2 kg with the pe 2 J, our chosen car mass had a greater of 3.9 J.It won’t fly off the tracks like the decreased mass.

Next we will discuss the Initial Drop Height. We suggest an Initial Drop Height of 1 meter. In our trials as Drop Increased the pe increased as well as speed. For instance, with a Drop Height of 0.4 meters the Initial PE and final ke were 3.9 J. When drop height was doubled to 0.8 meters, initial PE and final yes were 7.8 J. Equal initial pe and final KE showed the law of conservation of energy. The final speed did not change with different car masses. 

Hill Height will be discussed next. We suggest using the Hill height of 0.5 (m). As the hill height increased, the PE increased at the hill top. The speed at the hill top decreased with greater hill height. For example, a hill height of 0.6 (m) results in a hill top PE of 2.3 J. The PE of this lower hill is slightly less at 1.2 J

22,L3b7-22_RCFinal & L3b7-23_RCFinal,"The car will weigh 50 kilograms. The lift stands 95 meters tall. The car gains potential energy as it climbs. This energy has the potential of being used at the climax of the lift. It will be used. Since the height of the lift is so tall we made the car have less mass. The car’s next step is the drop.  As the car makes its way down, the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, its active energy that is moving the car. As the car goes down, all potential energy is converted into kinetic energy when there is no friction.

The hill is another part of the ride. It is 0.35 meters tall. The Potential energy at the top of the hill was two Joules. Potential energy was calculated by mass*height*g. The Kienetic energy at the hill base was 2.9 Joules. This was calculated by 1/2*mass*velocity^2.",unacceptable,acceptable,unacceptable
75,L1c1-16_RCFinal proposal/L1c1-19_RCFinal proposal,"The car mass we choose for the car is 0.6 kg. , and potential energy is 1.2J, so that means the roller coaster will work more efficiently. We wanted to have a higher mass and intial drop height because that makes more potential energy for the ride based on the formula. For our initial drop height, we put it at 1m. Potential energy is the amount of stored energy you have for the rest of the ride. The height we choose is very high so the car gets a lot of K.E. It helps the car get really fast at the beginning to go over the .6 m hill height. So when the height of the hill increases the amount of P.E. decreases by .72. Our hill height was put at .60m. The more mass you have on a car, the more speed you will have going down the hill. The P.E. at the top .8J and the K.E. at top is .8 J which means K.E. At base 1.6 J.

28,L3b5-21_RCFinal,"The car mass we selected is .027kg.  A small car mass has less potential and kinetic energy, but we can counteract that by increasing the initial drop height. We selected a lift height of .87 m. This gives the car enough potential energy to make it through the ride.The drop height of the roller coaster is .87m.the drop has a lot of potential energy, which is converted to kinetic energy and used to go down the initial drop.

26, L3b7-17_RCFinal,"Initial drop:
        First comes the initial drop which was height of .9m. We made it this height also because we would then have enough energy to go through the entire ride. At the top of the initial drop we had Potential Energy of 4.4j. When increasing height, potential Energy will increase too because of the formula, mass•height•gravity=Potential Energy. So increasing any one of those variables will cause the possible energy, Potential, to increase. Same with decreasing also with changing of height speed will change as well. Once you go down the initial drop you will go over the hill of .5m. Lastly, is the car stopping point. It stoped because there wasn’t enough energy to get over the hill. This is because of the conservation of energy, energy cant be created not destroyed.

For the Gonzales family we chose .6 meters for our height for the initial height. Our height and mass of the car .5kg sets the amount of PE for the rest of our track which is 2.9 joules. The more height and mass there is, the more potential energy at the top and kinetic energy at the bottom.
        Our Initial Drop height we chose was .8m.Our initial drop starting out with 2.9 joules of potential energy waiting to turn into kinetic energy. As you go down you lose some of the kinetic energy to heat energy. On our next part we have a gradual hill. 2 joules of potential energy to use at the top. We choose a height of .43m because when we tried to make a hill higher than the initial drop, there was not enough energy for the car to make it over.

54,L1c3-16_RCFinal proposal,"My group and I chose the car mass to be 0.6 kg. The heavier the mass, the more potential energy it has. 0.6 kg is the best because it wouldn’t go too fast and it wouldn’t be too slow. My group and I have chosen the initial drop height to be 1 meter. When we did the tests, none of the manipulated variables was 1 meters. We decided to put the initial drop up one more level to 1 meter. To make sure that it is safe, my group and I tested it with the simulation. My group and I chose the hill height to be 0.8 meters for a few reasons. First of all, we tried to make the hill smaller then the initial drop. The results of that ( we tried .4 m) were bad because the speed was too high. Then we had the hill be .6 meters. But that wasn’t;t too good. Then we tried .8 meters which had an red flags for the speed. That made us decide that this was best.",unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
34,L1c2-13_RC,"The first thing we had to decide was the mass and the lift height. Our team decided on a mass of .74kg and a lift height of 1m. We chose that mass because we didn't want it to be too heavy because then it wouldn't be able to make it over the loops. When mass was .2kg the Potential energy at the top was 2J, and then we increased the mass to .4kg the potential energy increased to 3.9J. The mass of .74kg isn't too high to be unsafe because if Potential energy was too high the car would go down the hill with too much force. The next thing we decided on was the initial drop height, and our company chose 1m. Both potential energy, at the top, and kinetic energy, at the bottom, increased with a higher height. They increased by 2J every time the height went up by .2m. The total energy is the Potential energy plus the Kinetic energy, so that also increased. Potential energy is highest at the top of the drop because it's energy at rest. Kinetic energy is highest at the bottom because it's energy at motion. Energy can't be created or destroyed but can change it's form. The third thing the team decided on was the hill height. We chose a height of .62m. We wanted to make it high for more fun, but if it was any heigher the car wouldn't have enough energy to make it over. If our hill height was heigher than the initial drop there's mo way the car would make it over. The car wouldn't have energy to make it over a hill heigher than the initial drop because since energy cannot be created the amount of energy you have from the initial drop will stay the for the hill. you can't create more energy to get over a higher hill.",acceptable,acceptable,acceptable
7,L3b8-14_RCFinal proposal,"For the car lift we decided that the car would be .4 kg in weight. The height is 1 m. We chose this height because it gave us the most potential energy to work with which was 3.8 Joules. We wanted as much potential energy as possible so that we knew it would make it over all the hills and through all the loops. Because of the Law of Conservation of Energy, which states that energy can’t be created or destroyed, the car still has the same amount of energy at the bottom as it did al the top of the drop. At the top of the drop, the car had 3.8 Joules of potential energy. At the end the car still has 3.8 Joules of energy, but instead of being in a useable form, it is in the unusable form of heat energy.",unacceptable,unacceptable,acceptable
43,L3b8-01_RCFinal proposal,"The mass of the car would be 50 kg. I decided on this mass because with more mass, you get more potential energy. The car would start on a 100 meter tall initial drop. I chose this height because it is large enough to get a large amount of potential energy. Another reason to have this height is the speed it produces, with more height an object will have more speed. The hill height is 14 meters. In the stopping, the friction will make the car’s kinetic energy turn into heat energy, but the systems total amount of energy will always be the same according to the law of conservation of energy. Loss of kinetic energy will cause the car to slow down. ",unacceptable,unacceptable,acceptable
59,L1c3-10_RCFinal proposal,"First of all the mass my company decided for the car is 0.4 kg. The next part of your Rollar Coaster is the Initial Drop. We picked 1 m for the height of the Initial Drop. We picked this height because of the height of the hill. The Law of Conservation of Energy states tha energy is neither created nor destroyed, only transfered. This relates to the Rollar Coaster because the Potential Energy at the top of the hill is 3.9 J. This is enough energy to make it over the hill which is 0.5 m. We also picked this height because of the speed at the bottem of the hill which is 4.43 m/s. Also the K.E. Is 3.9J. 

The third part of the Rollar Coaster is the hill. We made the hill 0.5 m tall. We made it this height so it would be tall enough to be fun, but short enough so the car can get over it. 

The last part of your Rollar Coaster was the long stretch that would bring the car to a stop. The stopping distance isn’t effected by mass, but height does. As the height of the Initial Drop increases, so does the distance the car goes. This is because there is more potential energy if the height increases.

41,L3b8-05_RCFinal proposal,"We decided to make the car be lifted up 90m. The car of this height will have a good amount of potential energy. If the height of the initial drop increases, then the speed of the car will be greater. The car lift is efficient because here mass of our car is 50kg which means that the potential energy  is high. The potential and kinetic energy increases as mass increases. For the initial drop, the amount of Kinetic energy at the bottom is close to the amount of potential energy at the top. The potential energy that doesn’t change into kinetic energy turns into heat energy. This happens because our roller coaster has friction. As the height of the initial drop or the mass of the car raises the potential energy raises too. The next part to our rollercoasters is the hill. The height we chose for the hill was 50m tall. The final part of our roller coaster is the stopping section. The car comes into the stopping section with a relatively high speed.",unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable

Equal initial pe and final KE showed the law of conservation of energy. As the hill height increased, the PE increased at the hill top. Our chosen hill height was safer than a lower hill height, because the speed at the top was less. For example, a hill height of 0.6 (m) results in a hill top PE of 2.3 J . The PE of this lower hill is slightly less at 1.2 J. The ke at hill base was also similar due to the lack of friction (3.9J), as was (the) ke at hill top (1.6J).",unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
68,L1c2-23_RCFinal proposal,"The mass chosen was 0.5 kg because it has a good amount of potential energy (P.E.) at 3.9 J which is created by going up the lift height of 0.8m which gives enough time for an amount of energy that will carry the car over the lift. We found greater mass means more energy. 
        The initial drop height (I.D.) chosen was 0.8 m. The company chose this height because it is high enough to reach a  good amount of P.E. at 3.9 J which will create a speed to go over the track, but with the kinetic energy of 3.9 J, that the P.E. from the drop  transferred into, the riders are safe from going off track. Unlike the height of 0.6m which only has a potential energy of 2.9 J, it has more potential energy when it is higher.
        The hill height chosen was 0.43 m. We chose this because it coincides well. Since an object in motion stays in motion, the car won’t change speed going over the hill and could easily stop or fly off track which this height prevents. Also if the hill is too high the car won’t make it over.
