We decided to do this because energy can be created or destroyed. Next, We decided to go with two hills and one loop. Our hill which we concluded would be 50 meters. We did this because when the roller coaster rolls down the initial drop it only has a certain amount of potential energy, and when it goes up the hill we will lose some potenial energy. The energy we loose will turn into heat energy. Through our testing, we found that a car with leoss mass would be easier. '",

I selected a height of .96 meters for my car lift. This way my car can have more potential Energy (PE= m• g • h). By having more potential energy, it means that more can be transformed into kienetic Energy. So, as a result more of the potential energy will turn into kinetic energy, Rather than Heat Energy.           Being that the height of my roller coaster is so highheight, it creates more potential energy, because there is more height. my roller coaster has 0.00815J of energy that can be used later on during roller coaster. After the Initial drop my roller coaster ended with about the same amount of Joules of Energy. All the energy forms added up to 0.00815 Joules of Energy. This is stated in the Law of Conservation of Energy, that no energy can be created or destroyed. '",

Please say Yes if it defines the concept at the input correctly, otherwise say No. Here is the student paragraph: 'This is the roller coaster design that I have created. This roller coaster has an initial drop along with a hill before it comes to a stop. It has an initial height of 1m and is enough to build the feeling of suspense just before the ride drops down. The cart has a mass of 0.5kg and I specifically choose this because it is not to heavy or too light. That way, the customers will not feel as if they are going to get thrown out of the ride. At the lift of the ride. The following energy principle can be seen below. The formula gives the value that the kinetic energy is directly proportional to the potential energy. All kinetic energy as it is going to the highest point at the lift will be converted to potential energy. At the highest point, the potential energy is equivalent to 5J.  At the drop point, the customers would scream and yell the most. The potential energy is being converted to kinetic energy at this instance. This means that the roller coaster will speed up as you are going down the track. The kinetic energy gained from the first height allows the cart to obtain enough energy for it to pass through the first hill. The first hill has a height of 0.43m. To make sure that the cart passes through this height.        The kinetic energy achieved from the first drop must be bigger than the potential energy required for the first hill. If the energy is not enough, then the roller coaster will not be able to get over the height of the hill. The customers should feel as if they are inside a plane experiencing bumpiness as the the roller coaster is going up and down. This should be a great design for the amusement park ride. '",

We made the hill the same size as our initial drop because we want to make it go over the hill. At the base, there is only kinetic energy due to the potential energy being burned off. But at the top of the hill, there is replenished potential energy to use. In the stopping section, it burns off kinetic energy and the potential energy it gains is burned off in the sandy stopping zone. '",

Please say Yes if it defines the concept at the input correctly, otherwise say No. Here is the student paragraph: 'We decided to make the car be lifted up 90m. The car of this height will have a good amount of potential energy. If the height of the initial drop increases, then the speed of the car will be greater. The car lift is efficient because here mass of our car is 50kg which means that the potential energy  is high. The potential and kinetic energy increases as mass increases. For the initial drop, the amount of Kinetic energy at the bottom is close to the amount of potential energy at the top. The potential energy that doesn’t change into kinetic energy turns into heat energy. This happens because our roller coaster has friction. As the height of the initial drop or the mass of the car raises the potential energy raises too. The next part to our rollercoasters is the hill. The height we chose for the hill was 50m tall. The final part of our roller coaster is the stopping section. The car comes into the stopping section with a relatively high speed.'",

PE is the energy of position and the higher an object is, the more energy it has stored. My company choose are hill height to be .55m. Reason 1 we choose this number because we had it to be small enough so it could go over the hill.

The next part of your Rollar Coaster is the Initial Drop. We picked 1 m for the height of the Initial Drop. We picked this height because of the height of the hill. The Law of Conservation of Energy states tha energy is neither created nor destroyed, only transfered. This relates to the Rollar Coaster because the Potential Energy at the top of the hill is 3.9 J. This is enough energy to make it over the hill which is 0.5 m. We also picked this height because of the speed at the bottem of the hill which is 4.43 m/s. Also the K.E. Is 3.9J. The third part of the Rollar Coaster is the hill. We made the hill 0.5 m tall. We made it this height so it would be tall enough to be fun, but short enough so the car can get over it. The last part of your Rollar Coaster was the long stretch that would bring the car to a stop. The stopping distance isn’t effected by mass, but height does. As the height of the Initial Drop increases, so does the distance the car goes. This is because there is more potential energy if the height increases. '",

Please say Yes if it defines the concept at the input correctly, otherwise say No. Here is the student paragraph: 'To start off with, our firm chose .6kg as a car mass. One of the reasons is that during the experiments, 2 kg as a car mass reached 2 J for potential energy,.4 kg had 3.9 J for potential energy & .8 had 7.8 J as a potential energy, so for an extra experiment, the car mass of .6 had reached 5.9 J , and 5.9 J seemed to be the perfect number, as the level would be high enough to make it up the hill, and not to take up more money for more track, because it takes P.E. to make it up the hill, as potential energy goes down, kinetic energy goes up, as kinetic energy is the energy of a moving object, an potential energy is the energy an object something potentially has, and since, as the law of conservation proves, since energy cannot be created, nor destroyed, only transferred, P.E. is transferred to become K.E. and with not friction, like in the simulation, k.E. and P.E. would be equal, but adding friction, like in the real life experiments, P.E. and K.K. will be different, so as some of the K.E. is ‘lost’ shall we say, (Not literally, as I said that energy cannot be destroyed, nor created) then it’ll take more P.E. to make it up the hill, but not so much as to have to add more track for it to stop, because adding more track is costly.        The firm chose for the initial drop height to be .8 m, and here’s why. You see, two things can affect the P.E. needed for it to make it up the hill, the car mass, and the lift height. Now, the initial drop affects the P.E. about the same as car mass does, for example, 0.2m=2J, 0.4m=3.9J, 0.6m=5.9J, and 0.8m=7.8J. Did you notice a pattern? It’s the same for mass except it’s kg instead of m, so basically, initial drop affects P.E. just as much as car mass does, but when both are considered, they can create a bigger number, after all, 5+5 is 10, not 5. Anyways, we chose 0.8 as an initial drop, (Let’s label it I.D from now one.) because, it’ll give us enough P.E to make it over the hill, like with the car, plus, in this, we kept and eye on speed, mostly because mass has no effect on speed so we didn’t mention that ; but height affects speed and a high level of speed can be dangerous. For the hill, the firm chose the height to be .6 m as it allowed the car to go over the hill.'",

Next comes the hill. For the hill height we chose 0.6m. We chose 0.6m because with the initial drop height at 0.8m and the friction of real life the hill could have been a little taller but not much, also with it taller It was way too slow and just barely made it over the hill.
