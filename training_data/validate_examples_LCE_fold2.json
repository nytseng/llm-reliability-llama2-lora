Please say Yes if it defines the concept at the input correctly, otherwise say No. Here is the student paragraph: 'When designing a roller coaster, you want to have a high initial drop. If the height of the initial drop is .65 meter, there will be more potential energy. To be exact, in the simulation, the potential energy was 3.9 joules. When the car moves down the drop, the potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy. But, in the real world, some kinetic energy will be lost to heat energy, but the total amount of energy is the same. This is because of the Law of Conservation of Energy. This law states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. Since the mass is small, this also affects the total energy. This is because more mass means more potential energy and kinetic energy.After this is over, we bring them back up a hill of 0.56 meters, just slightly lower than the initial hill. When they first begin dropping, they will feel a thrill. At the top of the hill, they will experience  the feeling of weightlessness. They wont stay up there long before being shot back down the hill, reaching a fast speed. Finally, after traveling a short distance the brakes will be added to the cart and it will come to a stop, which will give the riders one last feeling of force. Despite all these amazing features, we believe that the best aspect of our design is the fact that it is completely frictionless, so after the drop, no more energy needs to be added to the cart, making it very environmental and economical friendly. The combination of all these thrills will give the riders an experience they will never forget.'",

This roller coaster is the best. Tostart the roller coaster is the initial drop. It will be using a cart that is 5 grams, so their is enough mass to keep the car on track. Right at the top of the initial drop it will hold the cart just so it is at al most 80º Then hold it for 3 to 5 second to make it more intresting The Force used to pull the cart from the bottom to the Top will have to be big enough so it can pull it all the way back threw the track so people can rid it again        The inetial drop like I said the height is .77 meters high Then it will hold at The top for 3 to 5 seconds When it drops it will lossen the pully lines so it will feel like you’r falling  out of the The sky. Whem the cart is droped it will still stay in contact with the track so it does not go off the track and not make it safe at the Bottom it will be a gradual ride to a flat section.         On the hill the hill will not have way to much presure on the people on the ride so they would get supper hurt or even die. the hills height will be .5 meters high and have it be in like a black hole leading up to it then fly down the other side of the hill Then Their will be a slight flat section going to the loop.         Right when you get to the loop Their will be the track that has the end of the loop where you go from when you start To get on the loop and then when you get off the loop it will kinda be like a train changing lanes to go a different direction. The loop height will be .24 meters in height and diamiter ad when it gets to the loop it will have enough volocity To keep it from getting stuck at the top then falling out then not making it safe.         When The cart is don with the loop the caret will be stoping in ashort amount of timeThe amount of energy will be all taken away when it comes to the landing strip and that will be a section  When They get to a complete stop The cart will go back to the begaing but fast.

We have the great rollar coaster called Hoppolia! This is Icelandic for jumping in puddlies.We will have an elevator for people to get to the top. This will be efficient, because many people can fit on one elevator. Elevators are also very safe, because people can’t fall out and they have good speed. To spice the elevator up we can decorate it very creepy + have scary music play!Initial drop: To make sure our coaster can be fast we have the drop at 97 meters. It won’t take a lot of energy. The hight is good, because there will be gravity forces pushing down on people to keep them in there car. People will love this part not just for the stomach flip felling, but also the high speed! This rollar coaster will go about 30 m/s^2.loop: The loop is always everyone’s favorite part! This loop will be like no other! It will be so much fun no one know what hit them! There will be some room between the initial drop + the loop to slow things down. By the time it hits the loop it will be totally epic! This part will be coast cost effective because it is less expensive to buy. The loop diamiter will be 35 meters.hill: My hill is ment to give the riders that last stomach drop give the coaster the energy it needs to end the ride. The hight of the hill hight will be 27 meters high. This hight will be best to push it to the end + to make it fun! This is not to fast but fast enough. The car will still be going fairly fast from the loop, so rides can look forward to the fast hill too!At the end of the coaster, there will be water to stop in! No one will be expecting it, so its a nice surprise at the end! It won’t be like they drop into a tank of water, it’s just like a push to slow it down.  This is a good way to stop, because water will make it stop sooner!We hope you like your perpocil!,.'",

Please say Yes if it defines the concept at the input correctly, otherwise say No. Here is the student paragraph: 'When the initial height increases the PE will increase and the KE increases. If you increase the car mass then the amount of Potential energy and kinetic energy will also increase. We choose the drop height to be .8m because then it will have enough energy to go over .7m hill and a loop with a radius .2m. The greater the drop height the greater the PE, and KE. When the height was .2m there was .8J of PE at the top but there we increased the height to .4m the PE at the top was 1.6 J. We choose this drop height because the greater the drop height the greater PE and KE. When we choose .8 meters to be our drop height to make it fun but also safe. When we did .8 m in the simulation with a mass of .4kg it didn’t go over 40 m/s/s. Because the law of conversation of energy says that energy cannot be created or destroyed we had to choose appropriate drop height to get it over the hills and around the loop. When the car goes down the drop the Potiental energy is changed to KE because PE= m*h*9.8 and KE=m*1/2*v^2. As the hill height increases PE, KE increases. The hill height is higher than the initial drop then it will not have enough energy to make it over the hill. If you increase the hill height the PE increases at the top and so does the KE at the bottom. We choose a hill height of .7m because our drop height was .8m. There would only be KE at the bottom of the rollarcoaster because KE = m*1/2 *v.^2 and it has nothing to do with height but PE = m*h*. 9.8 so that is why PE i effected by height.'",

Please say Yes if it defines the concept at the input correctly, otherwise say No. Here is the student paragraph: 'Our rollercoaster has came to a final design proposal. First of all, lets start at the initial drop. We decided to make the car be lifted up 90m. This height is good because the car will have a good amount of potential energy that will allow the car to get over the hill. Another reason we chose a high initial drop height is when height increases, there is an increase in speed. the mass of our car is 50kg. The initial drop is perfect because the amount of Kinetic energy at the bottom isn’t too close to the amount of potential energy at the top. The potential energy that doesn’t change into kinetic energy turns into heat energy. The initial drop is also good because the drop height is 90m high. If we would’ve made the initial drop any higher it would’ve been too much because as the height of the initial drop or the mass of the car  raises the potential energy raises too. This happens because the formula for potential energy is mass x height x gravity. The initial drop has the amount of potential energy changing into kinetic energy doesn’t have a big difference in the number of Juoles. this happens because the formula for Kinetic energy is 1/2 x m x v^2. The next part to our rollercoasters is the hill and loop. The height we chose for the hill was 50m tall'",

I selected a height of .96 meters for my car lift. This way my car can have more potential Energy (PE= m• g • h). By having more potential energy, it means that more can be transformed into kienetic Energy. So, as a result more of the potential energy will turn into kinetic energy, Rather than Heat Energy.           Being that the height of my roller coaster is so highheight, it creates more potential energy, because there is more height. my roller coaster has 0.00815J of energy that can be used later on during roller coaster. After the Initial drop my roller coaster ended with about the same amount of Joules of Energy. All the energy forms added up to 0.00815 Joules of Energy.

So increasing any one of those variables will cause the possible energy, Potential, to increase. Same with decreasing also with changing of height speed will change as well. Once you go down the initial drop you will go over the hill of .5m. Lastly, is the car stopping point. It stoped because there wasn’t enough energy to get over the hill.

The reasoning behind our choice of Car Mass is the reasonable amount of Potential Energy (pe). For example, a 0.4 kg mass resulted in 3.9 J of pe. A greater Car Mass of 0.8 kg  resulted in 7.8 J of pe. For all of these trials we used a lift height of 1 meter. We suggest an Initial Drop Height of 1 meter. In our trials as Drop Increased the pe increased. For instance, with a Drop Height of 0.4 meters the Initial PE and final ke were 3.9 J. Equal initial pe and final KE showed the law of conservation of energy. As the hill height increased, the PE increased at the hill top. Our chosen hill height was safer than a lower hill height, because the speed at the top was less. For example, a hill height of 0.6 (m) results in a hill top PE of 2.3 J . The PE of this lower hill is slightly less at 1.2 J. The ke at hill base was also similar due to the lack of friction (3.9J), as was (the) ke at hill top (1.6J).'",

The results of that ( we tried .4 m) were bad because the speed was too high. Then we had the hill be .6 meters. But that wasn’t;t too good.

Please say Yes if it defines the concept at the input correctly, otherwise say No. Here is the student paragraph: '0.4 kg. would be the best amount for car mass. To start off with, 0.4 kg would be the best mass for the car because, since the car is lighter than .8 kg. Also, since the initial drop height isn’t too high, you don’t have to decrease the mass anymore. Also, the car is 0.4 kg, which is heavier than 0.2 kg. So at the top of the initial drop, the car will have 3.9 J for the initial potential energy instead of only 2 J. Mass does not affect speed so this doesn’t play a role. 0.4 kg for the car mass doesn’t take as much energy as heavier car masses. And the increased car mass increases KE( the energy of motion), so the car will go fast and create a thrilling experience.One meter would be the best height for the initial drop. First of all, the increased height increases potential energy. So the potential energy at the top of the initial drop with a height of 1m would be 9.8 J. This amount of PE is greater than the .2m height, the .4m height, the .6m height, and the .8m height. The potential energy for those heights were 2 J, 3.9 J, 5.9 J, and 7.8 J. Also, the KE at the bottom of the drop was increased also for 1 m as the height. The KE was 9.8 J. This amount of KE is greater than the other heights. The KE at the bottom of those hill heights was only 2 J, 3.9 J, 5.9 J, and 7.9 J. Lastly, the Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed but can be transfered to different dorms. This relates to the initial drop height because the height needs to be tall enough so the car has enough energy to go over the hill. If the initial drop height was increased any more, the car would go to fast.0.5 m would be the best height for the hill. One reason this height is the best is because 0.5 m is not tall than the initial drop height (1m) so the car has enough energy (about 4 J) to make it over the hill. If the hill was taller, say, 1m, and the initial drop was also 1m, than the car wouldn’t be able to make it over the hill. This also is related to Law of Conservation of Energy because energy cannot be created in the car to go over the hill. The initial drop builds up energy in the car, but if the car doesn’t have enough energy, it cannot be created.'",

We found greater mass means more energy.         The initial drop height (I.D.) chosen was 0.8 m. The company chose this height because it is high enough to reach a  good amount of P.E. at 3.9 J which will create a speed to go over the track, but with the kinetic energy of 3.9 J, that the P.E. from the drop  transferred into, the riders are safe from going off track. Unlike the height of 0.6m which only has a potential energy of 2.9 J, it has more potential energy when it is higher.        The hill height chosen was 0.43 m. We chose this because it coincides well. Since an object in motion stays in motion, the car won’t change speed going over the hill and could easily stop or fly off track which this height prevents. Also if the hill is too high the car won’t make it over. '",
