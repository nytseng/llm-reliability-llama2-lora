The initial hill height that I choose was 45 meters because we wanted it to be the tallest height as possible so it would have the most potential energy. I choose this height because it will have more potential energy to go all over the rollercoaster. During the initial drop, most of the js of PE will be transforming into K.E.E with the loss of heat. I choose 25 meters hill height because the car would have less kinetic energy when going down hill into the stopping point. We could not make the hill taller than the initial drop because of the Law of Conservation of energy, which says energy cannot be created or destroyed. The hill will be good because they are still using energy from the initial drop. The final part of the Pacific Coaster is the stopping portion, ending in water. Potential energy was tranformed into heat energy, instead of K.E.The car will also have a lot more potential energy than a bigger car with a smaller mass. The car mass that I choose was 25kg. I choose this car mass because it won’t be so difficult to take the car to the top of the initial drop and our car had the greatest mass, so that these was the most potential energy as possible. There will not be an increase in speed, even if mass increases because speed increases with an increase in drop height.",

While testing to find the best drop height we learned that if you increase the height, the amount of potential energy also increases. We took a height of .2 meters and the potential energy was .6 Joules. Then we took a height of .4 meters and we saw that the potential energy increased to 1.2 Joules. This was how we discovered an increase in height gives you a higher potential energy. When you have friction on the initial drop, the potential energy at the top of the hill will NOT equal the kenetic energy at the bottom of the drop.

If the height of the initial drop is .65 meter, there will be more potential energy. To be exact, in the simulation, the potential energy was 3.9 joules. When the car moves down the drop, the potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy. But, in the real world, some kinetic energy will be lost to heat energy, but the total amount of energy is the same. This is because of the Law of Conservation of Energy. This law states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. Since the mass is small, this also affects the total energy. This is because more mass means more potential energy and kinetic energy.After this is over, we bring them back up a hill of 0.56 meters, just slightly lower than the initial hill. When they first begin dropping, they will feel a thrill. At the top of the hill, they will experience  the feeling of weightlessness. They wont stay up there long before being shot back down the hill, reaching a fast speed. Finally, after traveling a short distance the brakes will be added to the cart and it will come to a stop, which will give the riders one last feeling of force. Despite all these amazing features, we believe that the best aspect of our design is the fact that it is completely frictionless, so after the drop, no more energy needs to be added to the cart, making it very environmental and economical friendly. The combination of all these thrills will give the riders an experience they will never forget.",

Right at the top of the initial drop it will hold the cart just so it is at al most 80º Then hold it for 3 to 5 second to make it more intresting The Force used to pull the cart from the bottom to the Top will have to be big enough so it can pull it all the way back threw the track so people can rid it again        The inetial drop like I said the height is .77 meters high Then it will hold at The top for 3 to 5 seconds When it drops it will lossen the pully lines so it will feel like you’r falling  out of the The sky. Whem the cart is droped it will still stay in contact with the track so it does not go off the track and not make it safe at the Bottom it will be a gradual ride to a flat section.         On the hill the hill will not have way to much presure on the people on the ride so they would get supper hurt or even die. the hills height will be .5 meters high and have it be in like a black hole leading up to it then fly down the other side of the hill Then Their will be a slight flat section going to the loop.

Another reason we chose a high initial drop height is when height increases, there is an increase in speed. the mass of our car is 50kg. The initial drop is perfect because the amount of Kinetic energy at the bottom isn’t too close to the amount of potential energy at the top.

If we would’ve made the initial drop any higher it would’ve been too much because as the height of the initial drop or the mass of the car  raises the potential energy raises too. This happens because the formula for potential energy is mass x height x gravity. The initial drop has the amount of potential energy changing into kinetic energy doesn’t have a big difference in the number of Juoles. this happens because the formula for Kinetic energy is 1/2 x m x v^2.

I choose this height because it is very tall, giving the car a lot of potential energy. Potential energy is the amount of stored energy an object can use. Potential energy can be converted into kenetic energy, which is the amount of energy an object has in motion. Therefore, if you have a lot of potential energy, you will also get a lot of kenetic energy. This also means that if a rollercoaster has no height, it has no potential energy and if the rollercoaster is not moving, it has no kienetic energy. So, before the rollercoaster goes up the initial drop, it has potential energy or kenetic energy. At the top of the initial drop, it has potential energy but not kenetic energy. You can determine how much potential energy the rollercoaster has by using the formula PE=m•g•h (PE=potential energy, m=mass, g=9.8(acceleration due to gravity) and h=height of hill.) If you use this formula, you will find out that my rollercoaster has 0.083 Jewls of energy at the top of the initial drop. (My mass was 0.00866 kilograms.) This rule applies to all parts of the rollercoaster. Another reason we chose a high initial drop height is when height increases, there is an increase in speed.        After the rollercoaster goes down the initial drop.  I choose the hill height of 0.32 meters because of the Law of Conservation of Energy. This law says that energy can’t be created or destroyed.

I used an incline of 0.16 meters tall at the very end of the rollercoaster so that the rollercoaster will go up the incline and fall back because it won’t have enough energy to make it all the way to the top. I chose this method of stopping because it doesn’t require a lot of track to stop.

The ride proposed is fun as the big differences in height from the falls make people feel adrenaline therefore, they will feel different but in a good way. Also, it is safe as there are friction controllers on the ride to make the cart slow down whenever it is reaching high points so that it stays on track and safe. The first part of the track is the initial drop, which is a the maximum height. The car at the top is positions to go down the ramp. At this point the potential energy is at its maximum which means that the cart must have not be moving. So, once the cart slides, it goes down the drop. This makes it safer for everyone as it avoids risks of going out of the ride. Then, at the bottom the cart is at its maximum kinetic energy and 0 potential as it is at ground level. Then, there is a hill where the cart reaches a maximum height lower than the previous one. In this part the cart slows down as it reaches the maximum height were its kinetic energy is 0 again.

It involves a drop and a hill. For the mass of the cart,  I chose the mass of the cart to be 0.5 kg so it would not be too massive to prevent passengers from riding, but not to light to the point where the cart travels too fast the flies off the track. The beginning part of the coaster consists of a track at the top of an initial drop. The cart reaches the top- a safe height that also allows for fast speeds. The higher the cart is placed, the more potential energy is has that can be transformed into kinetic energy which makes the cart travel faster. This height is large enough for a very fast speed but is still safe for the riders. As the car drops, all of the cart’s potential energy turns into kinetic energy that speeds up the cart. The cart goes down the track making it one of the more exciting parts of the ride. The third part of the track involves a curve and a hill, which is 0.4 m high, the cart climbs and then goes over. This part of the track is frictionless so the cart can move faster without being slowed down. This allows the kinetic energy of the cart coming down the initial drop to be transformed into potential energy as the cart climbs the hill. This gained potential energy will immediately be turned into kinetic energy as the cart slides back down the final hill, increasing the speed of the cart, and making it a fun, fast-paced ride. No friction could be a concern because the cart could go to fast This is compensated by the height of the hill. As the hill gets higher, the chances of the cart reaching these dangerous speeds would be less. To implement this coaster in your amusement park, a large scale-up would be needed to create this simulation on a real, much larger scale. ",

A greater Car Mass of 0.8 kg  resulted in 7.8 J of pe. For all of these trials we used a lift height of 1 meter. We suggest an Initial Drop Height of 1 meter. In our trials as Drop Increased the pe increased. For instance, with a Drop Height of 0.4 meters the Initial PE and final ke were 3.9 J. Equal initial pe and final KE showed the law of conservation of energy. As the hill height increased, the PE increased at the hill top. Our chosen hill height was safer than a lower hill height, because the speed at the top was less. For example, a hill height of 0.6 (m) results in a hill top PE of 2.3 J . The PE of this lower hill is slightly less at 1.2 J. The ke at hill base was also similar due to the lack of friction (3.9J), as was (the) ke at hill top (1.6J).",

One of the reasons is that during the experiments, 2 kg as a car mass reached 2 J for potential energy,.4 kg had 3.9 J for potential energy & .8 had 7.8 J as a potential energy, so for an extra experiment, the car mass of .6 had reached 5.9 J , and 5.9 J seemed to be the perfect number, as the level would be high enough to make it up the hill, and not to take up more money for more track, because it takes P.E. to make it up the hill, as potential energy goes down, kinetic energy goes up, as kinetic energy is the energy of a moving object, an potential energy is the energy an object something potentially has, and since, as the law of conservation proves, since energy cannot be created, nor destroyed, only transferred, P.E. is transferred to become K.E. and with not friction, like in the simulation, k.E. and P.E. would be equal, but adding friction, like in the real life experiments, P.E. and K.K. will be different, so as some of the K.E. is ‘lost’ shall we say, (Not literally, as I said that energy cannot be destroyed, nor created) then it’ll take more P.E. to make it up the hill, but not so much as to have to add more track for it to stop, because adding more track is costly.        The firm chose for the initial drop height to be .8 m, and here’s why. You see, two things can affect the P.E. needed for it to make it up the hill, the car mass, and the lift height. Now, the initial drop affects the P.E. about the same as car mass does, for example, 0.2m=2J, 0.4m=3.9J, 0.6m=5.9J, and 0.8m=7.8J. Did you notice a pattern? It’s the same for mass except it’s kg instead of m, so basically, initial drop affects P.E. just as much as car mass does, but when both are considered, they can create a bigger number, after all, 5+5 is 10, not 5. Anyways, we chose 0.8 as an initial drop, (Let’s label it I.D from now one.) because, it’ll give us enough P.E to make it over the hill, like with the car, plus, in this, we kept and eye on speed, mostly because mass has no effect on speed so we didn’t mention that ; but height affects speed and a high level of speed can be dangerous.

To start off with, 0.4 kg would be the best mass for the car because, since the car is lighter than .8 kg. Also, since the initial drop height isn’t too high, you don’t have to decrease the mass anymore. Also, the car is 0.4 kg, which is heavier than 0.2 kg. So at the top of the initial drop, the car will have 3.9 J for the initial potential energy instead of only 2 J. Mass does not affect speed so this doesn’t play a role. 0.4 kg for the car mass doesn’t take as much energy as heavier car masses. And the increased car mass increases KE( the energy of motion), so the car will go fast and create a thrilling experience.One meter would be the best height for the initial drop. First of all, the increased height increases potential energy. So the potential energy at the top of the initial drop with a height of 1m would be 9.8 J. This amount of PE is greater than the .2m height, the .4m height, the .6m height, and the .8m height. The potential energy for those heights were 2 J, 3.9 J, 5.9 J, and 7.8 J. Also, the KE at the bottom of the drop was increased also for 1 m as the height. The KE was 9.8 J. This amount of KE is greater than the other heights. The KE at the bottom of those hill heights was only 2 J, 3.9 J, 5.9 J, and 7.9 J. Lastly, the Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed but can be transfered to different dorms. This relates to the initial drop height because the height needs to be tall enough so the car has enough energy to go over the hill. If the initial drop height was increased any more, the car would go to fast.0.5 m would be the best height for the hill. One reason this height is the best is because 0.5 m is not tall than the initial drop height (1m) so the car has enough energy (about 4 J) to make it over the hill. If the hill was taller, say, 1m, and the initial drop was also 1m, than the car wouldn’t be able to make it over the hill. This also is related to Law of Conservation of Energy because energy cannot be created in the car to go over the hill.

This means that the car isn’t to heavy and colapse the track. For our Initial Drop height we chose 1 m. It has enough potential energy and also gives the car enough speed to get over the hill.  If the height were 0.6m the car would never make it up the hill if there was friction.We chose .62 for our hill height. Height is 0.62m because if the height was 0.7m then it would barely make it over the hill. At 0.8m the car wouldn’t make it over the hill at all. If the height was 0.5 m it exceeds the speed safety limit. ",

If the car mass is 0.3 kg, the roller coaster will still be just as fun as if the mass was 1kg because mass does not affect speed. The height is 60m tall. .For the height of the Initial Drop, the company chose 1m to maximize the charectoristics you asked for. The potential energy at the top is 2.9J. It won’t get you sick going up it but it might when you go down  it. The initial drop starts out with 2.9 J of potensial energy which by the end it will have about  2.4J left for the loop and the hill. The  hill is 40m tall and has low friction so it will make it through the whole hill. It will have 2J of potential energy at the top of the hill. It will also have 1J  of kinetic energy at the top and have 2.9J of kinetic energy at the bottom due to friction that turns into heat energy. ",

Our height and mass of the car .5kg sets the amount of PE for the rest of our track which is 2.9 joules. The more height and mass there is, the more potential energy at the top and kinetic energy at the bottom.        Our Initial Drop height we chose was .8m.Our initial drop starting out with 2.9 joules of potential energy waiting to turn into kinetic energy. As you go down you lose some of the kinetic energy to heat energy. On our next part we have a gradual hill. 2 joules of potential energy to use at the top. We choose a height of .43m because when we tried to make a hill higher than the initial drop, there was not enough energy for the car to make it over.",

The amount of potential energy is 7.3J. This is on the higher end for potential energy, which gives it enough speed to get over the hill. The amount of kinetic energy is 7.3J.         Then for the initial drop height, it was chosen to be 1m. This height gave a higher speed compared to a lower height. It also has more potential energy and kinetic energy compared to a lower height.        When choosing the hill height, the final height ended up as .62m.In the hands on experiments. If we made the hill taller than .62m, and it was higher than the drop, the car would not have enough energy to make it over the hill. ",

It seems to go over every hill that we choose. If we increased to .5kg or decreased it to .3kg, it wouldn’t go over the hill or have to much acceleration go down the hill. he initial drop is the most important part of the roller coaster, because that’s were the car is going to start it’s adventure and where P.E. is starting. My group chose .75m for the Initial drop height. We chose .75m because if the height of the initial drop was small, such as .40m then it might not have enough energy. My group chose our hill height to be .60m. We put our hill height at .60m because then one the way down the hill, the car get’s enough energy and speed to get up the next hill. ",

My team and I choose 0.2 kg car mass because that way it will be fun because when mass increases so does P.E.  The mass is in the middle and it has enough pe to get over another hill. For the initial drop, we chose 1m for height because it will have a lot of potential energy and the speed will be really high. The energy in the initial drop gains by speed. P.E. at the top of the drop is full but when it goes down it decreases. KE increases when P.E. goes down.For the hill height and shape we chose 0.4 m because it should be lower than the initial drop. Energy could not be created or destroyed as Law of Energy Conservation said, our hill height will make sure the car to go through the hill. KE and P.E. are at the top and the bottom. If there was friction there will be not Pe or Ke be-cause friction.",

The car mass we choose for the car is 0.6 kg. , and potential energy is 1.2J, so that means the roller coaster will work more efficiently. We wanted to have a higher mass and intial drop height because that makes more potential energy for the ride based on the formula. For our initial drop height, we put it at 1m. Potential energy is the amount of stored energy you have for the rest of the ride. The height we choose is very high so the car gets a lot of K.E. It helps the car get really fast at the beginning to go over the .6 m hill height. So when the height of the hill increases the amount of P.E. decreases by .72. Our hill height was put at .60m. The more mass you have on a car, the more speed you will have going down the hill. The P.E. at the top .8J and the K.E. at top is .8 J which means K.E. At base 1.6 J. ",
