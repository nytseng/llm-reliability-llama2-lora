Please say Yes if it defines the concept at the input correctly, otherwise say No. Here is the student paragraph: 'When designing a roller coaster, you want to have a high initial drop. If the height of the initial drop is .65 meter, there will be more potential energy. To be exact, in the simulation, the potential energy was 3.9 joules. When the car moves down the drop, the potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy. But, in the real world, some kinetic energy will be lost to heat energy, but the total amount of energy is the same. This is because of the Law of Conservation of Energy. This law states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. Since the mass is small, this also affects the total energy. This is because more mass means more potential energy and kinetic energy.After this is over, we bring them back up a hill of 0.56 meters, just slightly lower than the initial hill. When they first begin dropping, they will feel a thrill. At the top of the hill, they will experience  the feeling of weightlessness. They wont stay up there long before being shot back down the hill, reaching a fast speed. Finally, after traveling a short distance the brakes will be added to the cart and it will come to a stop, which will give the riders one last feeling of force. Despite all these amazing features, we believe that the best aspect of our design is the fact that it is completely frictionless, so after the drop, no more energy needs to be added to the cart, making it very environmental and economical friendly. The combination of all these thrills will give the riders an experience they will never forget.'",

The car’s potential energy will turn into kinetic energy, but the systems total amount of energy will always be the same according to the law of conservation of energy. Loss of kinetic energy will cause the car to slow down.

Please say Yes if it defines the concept at the input correctly, otherwise say No. Here is the student paragraph: 'In my roller coaster, I made the initial drop height 0.96 meters tall. I choose this height because it is very tall, giving the car a lot of potential energy. Potential energy is the amount of stored energy an object can use. Potential energy can be converted into kenetic energy, which is the amount of energy an object has in motion. Therefore, if you have a lot of potential energy, you will also get a lot of kenetic energy. This also means that if a rollercoaster has no height, it has no potential energy and if the rollercoaster is not moving, it has no kienetic energy. So, before the rollercoaster goes up the initial drop, it has potential energy or kenetic energy. At the top of the initial drop, it has potential energy but not kenetic energy. You can determine how much potential energy the rollercoaster has by using the formula PE=m•g•h (PE=potential energy, m=mass, g=9.8(acceleration due to gravity) and h=height of hill.) If you use this formula, you will find out that my rollercoaster has 0.083 Jewls of energy at the top of the initial drop. (My mass was 0.00866 kilograms.) This rule applies to all parts of the rollercoaster. Another reason we chose a high initial drop height is when height increases, there is an increase in speed.        After the rollercoaster goes down the initial drop.  I choose the hill height of 0.32 meters because of the Law of Conservation of Energy. This law says that energy can’t be created or destroyed. I used two things to stop the rollercoaster: friction and the Law of Concervation of Energy. I used an incline of 0.16 meters tall at the very end of the rollercoaster so that the rollercoaster will go up the incline and fall back because it won’t have enough energy to make it all the way to the top. I chose this method of stopping because it doesn’t require a lot of track to stop.         In conclusion, my rollercoaster has a lot of potential energy when it has a lot of mass and height and a lot of kienetic energy when it is in motion. My rollercoaster follows the Law of Concervation of Energy.'",

You see, originally we were going to have the coaster car weigh 0.2 kilograms, which would only give the coaster car to have 3.321 more Joules of energy, which definetly helps. The amount of kinetic energy was 4.2 Joules at the bottom of the drop. The potential energy at the top of the hill is 3.1Joules. the kinetic energy to be at 3. Joules.It will be 0.8 meters of the top of the drop, and 0.8 meters from start to the bottom of the highest point. Next, the car will go down it’s initial drop. Because the height is so high but the mass is so high, they will mostly balance out to the cars potential energy making it rise a little. The car will then go faster. It rises due to kinetic energy, which is converted from potential energy. As I said before, potential energy would be higher, around 3.1 Joules, because of the drop’s height. For instance, in a height with a 0.4 meter drop height, the potential energy was around 1.6 Joules, so less with a lesser height.'",

A greater Car Mass of 0.8 kg  resulted in 7.8 J of pe. For all of these trials we used a lift height of 1 meter. We suggest an Initial Drop Height of 1 meter. In our trials as Drop Increased the pe increased. For instance, with a Drop Height of 0.4 meters the Initial PE and final ke were 3.9 J. Equal initial pe and final KE showed the law of conservation of energy. As the hill height increased, the PE increased at the hill top. Our chosen hill height was safer than a lower hill height, because the speed at the top was less. For example, a hill height of 0.6 (m) results in a hill top PE of 2.3 J . The PE of this lower hill is slightly less at 1.2 J. The ke at hill base was also similar due to the lack of friction (3.9J), as was (the) ke at hill top (1.6J).'",

My group and I chose the hill height to be 0.8 meters for a few reasons. First of all, we tried to make the hill smaller then the initial drop. The results of that ( we tried .4 m) were bad because the speed was too high. Then we had the hill be .6 meters. But that wasn’t;t too good. Then we tried .8 meters which had an red flags for the speed. That made us decide that this was best.'",

This is enough energy to make it over the hill which is 0.5 m. We also picked this height because of the speed at the bottem of the hill which is 4.43 m/s. Also the K.E. Is 3.9J. The third part of the Rollar Coaster is the hill. We made the hill 0.5 m tall. We made it this height so it would be tall enough to be fun, but short enough so the car can get over it. The last part of your Rollar Coaster was the long stretch that would bring the car to a stop. The stopping distance isn’t effected by mass, but height does.

Please say Yes if it defines the concept at the input correctly, otherwise say No. Here is the student paragraph: '0.4 kg. would be the best amount for car mass. To start off with, 0.4 kg would be the best mass for the car because, since the car is lighter than .8 kg. Also, since the initial drop height isn’t too high, you don’t have to decrease the mass anymore. Also, the car is 0.4 kg, which is heavier than 0.2 kg. So at the top of the initial drop, the car will have 3.9 J for the initial potential energy instead of only 2 J. Mass does not affect speed so this doesn’t play a role. 0.4 kg for the car mass doesn’t take as much energy as heavier car masses. And the increased car mass increases KE( the energy of motion), so the car will go fast and create a thrilling experience.One meter would be the best height for the initial drop. First of all, the increased height increases potential energy. So the potential energy at the top of the initial drop with a height of 1m would be 9.8 J. This amount of PE is greater than the .2m height, the .4m height, the .6m height, and the .8m height. The potential energy for those heights were 2 J, 3.9 J, 5.9 J, and 7.8 J. Also, the KE at the bottom of the drop was increased also for 1 m as the height. The KE was 9.8 J. This amount of KE is greater than the other heights. The KE at the bottom of those hill heights was only 2 J, 3.9 J, 5.9 J, and 7.9 J. Lastly, the Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed but can be transfered to different dorms. This relates to the initial drop height because the height needs to be tall enough so the car has enough energy to go over the hill. If the initial drop height was increased any more, the car would go to fast.0.5 m would be the best height for the hill. One reason this height is the best is because 0.5 m is not tall than the initial drop height (1m) so the car has enough energy (about 4 J) to make it over the hill. If the hill was taller, say, 1m, and the initial drop was also 1m, than the car wouldn’t be able to make it over the hill. This also is related to Law of Conservation of Energy because energy cannot be created in the car to go over the hill. The initial drop builds up energy in the car, but if the car doesn’t have enough energy, it cannot be created.'",

So basically it doesn’t matter what the height is. The initial drop provides the kinetic energy 100%, required to have enough energy to get the car over the hill, and to the gate.
