I choose this height because it will have more potential energy to go all over the rollercoaster. During the initial drop, most of the js of PE will be transforming into K.E.E with the loss of heat. I choose 25 meters hill height because the car would have less kinetic energy when going down hill into the stopping point. We could not make the hill taller than the initial drop because of the Law of Conservation of energy, which says energy cannot be created or destroyed. The hill will be good because they are still using energy from the initial drop. The final part of the Pacific Coaster is the stopping portion, ending in water. Potential energy was tranformed into heat energy, instead of K.E.The car will also have a lot more potential energy than a bigger car with a smaller mass. The car mass that I choose was 25kg. I choose this car mass because it won’t be so difficult to take the car to the top of the initial drop and our car had the greatest mass, so that these was the most potential energy as possible. There will not be an increase in speed, even if mass increases because speed increases with an increase in drop height.'",

While testing to find the best drop height we learned that if you increase the height, the amount of potential energy also increases. We took a height of .2 meters and the potential energy was .6 Joules. Then we took a height of .4 meters and we saw that the potential energy increased to 1.2 Joules. This was how we discovered an increase in height gives you a higher potential energy. When you have friction on the initial drop, the potential energy at the top of the hill will NOT equal the kenetic energy at the bottom of the drop. This is because energy is being lost due to heat energy. This drop is an important part of the rollercoaster.'",

A lot of kinetic energy means a lot of motion, which is why our initial drop starts a fun ride. The .77m of potential energy turns into kinetic energy and heat energy.After the initial drop comes our hill and loop. We chose to make our hill height .5m high. In my simulation, I tested different hill heights. I found out that if the height is the same or higher than the initial drop height, than the car will not move it over the hill. Therefore, .5m was the perfect height and at the end of the hill It’s potential energy then became 0. '",

Please say Yes if it defines the concept at the input correctly, otherwise say No. Here is the student paragraph: 'In my roller coaster, I made the initial drop height 0.96 meters tall. I choose this height because it is very tall, giving the car a lot of potential energy. Potential energy is the amount of stored energy an object can use. Potential energy can be converted into kenetic energy, which is the amount of energy an object has in motion. Therefore, if you have a lot of potential energy, you will also get a lot of kenetic energy. This also means that if a rollercoaster has no height, it has no potential energy and if the rollercoaster is not moving, it has no kienetic energy. So, before the rollercoaster goes up the initial drop, it has potential energy or kenetic energy. At the top of the initial drop, it has potential energy but not kenetic energy. You can determine how much potential energy the rollercoaster has by using the formula PE=m•g•h (PE=potential energy, m=mass, g=9.8(acceleration due to gravity) and h=height of hill.) If you use this formula, you will find out that my rollercoaster has 0.083 Jewls of energy at the top of the initial drop. (My mass was 0.00866 kilograms.) This rule applies to all parts of the rollercoaster. Another reason we chose a high initial drop height is when height increases, there is an increase in speed.        After the rollercoaster goes down the initial drop.  I choose the hill height of 0.32 meters because of the Law of Conservation of Energy. This law says that energy can’t be created or destroyed. I used two things to stop the rollercoaster: friction and the Law of Concervation of Energy. I used an incline of 0.16 meters tall at the very end of the rollercoaster so that the rollercoaster will go up the incline and fall back because it won’t have enough energy to make it all the way to the top. I chose this method of stopping because it doesn’t require a lot of track to stop.         In conclusion, my rollercoaster has a lot of potential energy when it has a lot of mass and height and a lot of kienetic energy when it is in motion. My rollercoaster follows the Law of Concervation of Energy.'",

The design centers around allowing the passengers to experience the extreme drops. Using only potential and kinetic energy, the car is given enough kinetic and potential energy initially to carry it through the whole ride. The car will sit at the top of an initial drop that is 100 meteres high and then is allowed to fall down the slope of the initial drop.  As it rolls down the slope, the potential energy is converted into KE. As it reaches the bottom of the drop, though, the riders to experience the most thrilling aspect of the ride, and the kinetic energy of the car will carry it along the to the end. The car slows down as it approaches a small hill. At the peak, the converts most of its energy into PE. Then, it quickly accelerates downhill, turing back into KE for the passengers. After reaching the bottom of the hill, the car will slow down and stop to allow the passengers to get out.

The initial drop height of 1m was chosen because it gives enough speed to go over the track. It wouldn’t be to high so that it would go over the maximum speed limit.  When the car goes up, it gains Potential Energy because as it stops at the initial drop it is at it’s greatest and goes down while Kinetic Energy goes up when the car goes down the drop.

Please say Yes if it defines the concept at the input correctly, otherwise say No. Here is the student paragraph: 'The first thing we had to decide was the mass. Our team decided on a mass of .74kg. We chose that mass because we didn't want it to be too heavy because then it wouldn't be able to make it over the loops. When mass was .2kg the Potential energy at the top was 2J, and then we increased the mass to .4kg the potential energy increased to 3.9J. The mass of .74kg isn't too high to be unsafe because if Potential energy was too high the car would go down the hill. When the lift height increased by .2m the potential energy increased at the same rate as it did for mass. There will not be an increase in speed, even if mass increases because speed increases with an increase in drop height. With a mass of .74kg and a height of 1m the car will be able to make it over a surface with friction.         The next thing we decided on was the initial drop height, and our company chose 1m. With a higher height the car will go faster. Both potential energy, at the top, and kinetic energy, at the bottom, increased with a higher height. They increased by 2J every time the height went up by .2m. The total energy is the Potential energy plus the Kinetic energy, so that also increased. Potential energy is highest at the top of the drop because it's energy at rest. Kinetic energy is highest at the bottom because it's energy at motion. Energy can't be created or destroyed but can change it's form. When there's friction it creates heat so if there was Friction on the drop then potential energy would stay the same since friction doesn't affect it. Friction would decrease Kinetic energy.         The third thing the team decided on was the hill height. We chose a height of .62m. We wanted to make it high for more fun, but if it was any heigher the car wouldn't have enough energy to make it over. If our hill height was heigher than the initial drop there's mo way the car would make it over. The car wouldn't have energy to make it over a hill heigher than the initial drop because since energy cannot be created the amount of energy you have from the initial drop will stay the for the hill. you can't create more energy to get over a higher hill.
