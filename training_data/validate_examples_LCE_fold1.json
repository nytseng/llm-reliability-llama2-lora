It will be where all of the energy must be created in the form of Potential energy. A height of 90m would be just right because the initial drop can help the car to go over the hills with enough potential energy. I propose that we should make the roller coasters drop 90 meters tall because the roller coaster needs a lot of KE to go through the rest of the roller coaster. During initial drop, the increasing height increases potential energy at the top of hill and kinetic energy at the bottom of hill. When we increase the initial drop height the car has a faster speed so it'll be able to travel farther.The hill of the roller coaster is another critical part. It must be a smaller height than the initial drop to have enough energy to go up the hill. The hill can be .80 meter or less because it can’t be more than .89 meter because the potential energy would be transformed to kinetic energy with the loss of heat.  The hill has this height, the car will have enough Kinetic energy to get it over the hill. When increasing height and mass in car lift, potential energy increased.'",

I chose this height for the initial drop because 35m wasn’t too long or too short. If the height of the initial drop is low, than won’t have enough potential energy (PE) and the passengers would probably get stuck between the initial drop and the hill. The Law of Conservation of Energy says that no energy can made or destroyed. So the initial drop had  to have more than enough Potential energy to get over the loop and hills. Potential energy will be less due to  heat. The car would have 4.802J Potential energy but some will be  transformed to heat. If the hill was the same height as the hill or close to the hill height it would not be ideal because the car lost energy. It was transformed to heat energy. '",

When you have a steep drop it has more Potential energy at the top to change into Kinetic energy when it is going down. The coaster car has a mass of 0.5kg. On the top the Potential energy was 2.5 Joules, + on the bottom of the drop the Kienetic energy was 2.5 Joules. Both the energys at the top and bottom are still the same though due to the law of conservation of energy .  I also gave the hill some height differences. For the hill, I decided to put the height to about 0.3m to give some height difference so that there would be enough speed to go over the hill and also would give the customers more thrill through speed.'",

Potential energy is turned into kinetic energy. The potential energy is 1.6 J at the top but only 1.5 J at the bottom. The formula for kinetic energy is KE: m*v^v^2*½. Since the velocity is smaller the total kinetic energy will be smaller because of the formula. The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. Because of this law that extra .1 J of energy turns into heat energy because it cannot just disappear. The hill height is 7.5 m. The hill height must be less than the initial drop height or else there will not be enough energy built up to get the car over the hill. At the top of the hill there is 1.5 J of potential energy and at the bottom there is 1.4 J kinetic energy. If there was no friction the potential energy would be the same as the amount of KE.'",

The car gains potential energy as it climbs. This energy has the potential of being used at the climax of the lift. It will be used. Since the height of the lift is so tall we made the car have less mass. The car’s next step is the drop.  As the car makes its way down, the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, its active energy that is moving the car. As the car goes down, all potential energy is converted into kinetic energy when there is no friction.The hill is another part of the ride. It is 0.35 meters tall. The Potential energy at the top of the hill was two Joules. Potential energy was calculated by mass*height*g. The Kienetic energy at the hill base was 2.9 Joules.

Joules.It will be 0.8 meters of the top of the drop, and 0.8 meters from start to the bottom of the highest point. Next, the car will go down it’s initial drop. Because the height is so high but the mass is so high, they will mostly balance out to the cars potential energy making it rise a little. The car will then go faster. It rises due to kinetic energy, which is converted from potential energy. As I said before, potential energy would be higher, around 3.1 Joules, because of the drop’s height. For instance, in a height with a 0.4 meter drop height, the potential energy was around 1.6 Joules, so less with a lesser height.'",

Please say Yes if it defines the concept at the input correctly, otherwise say No. Here is the student paragraph: 'This is the roller coaster design that I have created. This roller coaster has an initial drop along with a hill before it comes to a stop. It has an initial height of 1m and is enough to build the feeling of suspense just before the ride drops down. The cart has a mass of 0.5kg and I specifically choose this because it is not to heavy or too light. That way, the customers will not feel as if they are going to get thrown out of the ride. At the lift of the ride. The following energy principle can be seen below. The formula gives the value that the kinetic energy is directly proportional to the potential energy. All kinetic energy as it is going to the highest point at the lift will be converted to potential energy. At the highest point, the potential energy is equivalent to 5J.  At the drop point, the customers would scream and yell the most. The potential energy is being converted to kinetic energy at this instance. This means that the roller coaster will speed up as you are going down the track. The kinetic energy gained from the first height allows the cart to obtain enough energy for it to pass through the first hill. The first hill has a height of 0.43m. To make sure that the cart passes through this height.        The kinetic energy achieved from the first drop must be bigger than the potential energy required for the first hill. If the energy is not enough, then the roller coaster will not be able to get over the height of the hill. The customers should feel as if they are inside a plane experiencing bumpiness as the the roller coaster is going up and down. This should be a great design for the amusement park ride. '",

My corporation decided to use 0.5kg because, we didn’t want it to be 0.8kg because it would be harder to get it up the hill. The initial drop provides the kinetic energy 100%, required to get the car over the hill, and to the gate. Its one meter tall, so having a tall height means more potential energy at the top. The total energy was 4.9 Joules. Having more energy means you can have more to the rollercoaster because it has more energy to lose.The initial drop is fun because of the high height. The height of the hill is .18meters. The hill is near the end of the ride, so at the top of the hill the potential energy is only 1 joule.'",

The reasoning behind our choice of Car Mass is the reasonable amount of Potential Energy (pe). The more mass the more PE. For example, a 0.4 kg mass resulted in 3.9 J of pe. A greater Car Mass of 0.8 kg resulted in 7.8 J of pe. Compared to the lowest Car Mass of 0.2 kg with the pe 2 J, our chosen car mass had a greater of 3.9 J.It won’t fly off the tracks like the decreased mass.Next we will discuss the Initial Drop Height. We suggest an Initial Drop Height of 1 meter. In our trials as Drop Increased the pe increased as well as speed. For instance, with a Drop Height of 0.4 meters the Initial PE and final ke were 3.9 J. When drop height was doubled to 0.8 meters, initial PE and final yes were 7.8 J. Equal initial pe and final KE showed the law of conservation of energy. The final speed did not change with different car masses. Hill Height will be discussed next. We suggest using the Hill height of 0.5 (m). As the hill height increased, the PE increased at the hill top. The speed at the hill top decreased with greater hill height. For example, a hill height of 0.6 (m) results in a hill top PE of 2.3 J. The PE of this lower hill is slightly less at 1.2 J'",

So we set our mass for .6kg then it will make our efficiency level 100% because Kenetic Energy was 4.7j, and Potential Energy is 0j. Our initial drop height is .7m that is Average, And if we had .6m drop height our car would not have enouigh energy to get over the hill, while on contrary if we had .8m drop height our car would accel the speed limit on the coaster. Our Hill height is at .6m. We chose this height because our initial Drop height .7m and if we put our hill height at the .7m initial drop height our car will never get over the hill, And if we put it at .5m-4m than our car will exceed the speed limit.
