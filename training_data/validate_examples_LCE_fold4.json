The drop converts all the stored potential energy into kinetic energy, giving it enough speed for the people to get thrill and enjoy. The more potential energy you have, the more energy you will have for the rest of the ride, which was our goal. In the initial drop, we took the Potential Energy and transformed it to Kinetic Energy. At the top, there is no Kinetic Energy because all the Potential Energy has yet to transform into Kinetic Energy. The higher the initial drop height got, the more potential energy you had.  Also, all the potential energy had transformed into Kinetic energy. Also, when the mass went up, so did the potential energy. This means, the more mass you have, the more potential energy you will have. Also, mass doesn’t affect speed.The Hill It has a height of 0.42m. to give the thrill to the people, by slowing down the ride while going up, and speeding it back up when it goes down. The principle involved is again the energy principle, as kinetic energy is partially converted into potential energy while going up and then this potential energy is again converted into kinetic energy.

We did this because when the roller coaster rolls down the initial drop it only has a certain amount of potential energy, and when it goes up the hill we will lose some potenial energy. The energy we loose will turn into heat energy. Through our testing, we found that a car with leoss mass would be easier. '",

The car’s potential energy will turn into kinetic energy, but the systems total amount of energy will always be the same according to the law of conservation of energy. Loss of kinetic energy will cause the car to slow down.

Please say Yes if it defines the concept at the input correctly, otherwise say No. Here is the student paragraph: 'The first thing we had to decide was the mass and the lift height. Our team decided on a mass of .74kg and a lift height of 1m. We chose that mass because we didn't want it to be too heavy because then it wouldn't be able to make it over the loops. When mass was .2kg the Potential energy at the top was 2J, and then we increased the mass to .4kg the potential energy increased to 3.9J. The mass of .74kg isn't too high to be unsafe because if Potential energy was too high the car would go down the hill with too much force. The next thing we decided on was the initial drop height, and our company chose 1m. Both potential energy, at the top, and kinetic energy, at the bottom, increased with a higher height. They increased by 2J every time the height went up by .2m. The total energy is the Potential energy plus the Kinetic energy, so that also increased. Potential energy is highest at the top of the drop because it's energy at rest. Kinetic energy is highest at the bottom because it's energy at motion. Energy can't be created or destroyed but can change it's form. The third thing the team decided on was the hill height. We chose a height of .62m. We wanted to make it high for more fun, but if it was any heigher the car wouldn't have enough energy to make it over. If our hill height was heigher than the initial drop there's mo way the car would make it over. The car wouldn't have energy to make it over a hill heigher than the initial drop because since energy cannot be created the amount of energy you have from the initial drop will stay the for the hill. you can't create more energy to get over a higher hill.'",

The height isn’t too high and our car mass isn’t too high. Next, we made our initial drop, which was .77m high. We chose this height because it caused the car to have a lot of potential energy, which is measured in joules. I also knew that when you increase the drop height, you increase the potential energy, which increases the kinetic energy at the end of the drop. A lot of kinetic energy means a lot of motion. The .77m of potential energy turns into kinetic energy and heat energy. The speed increases when your going down the drop. The car gains speed.         After the initial drop comes our hill. We chose to make our hill height .5m high. In my simulation, I tested different hill heights. I found out that if the height is the same or higher than the initial drop height, than the car will not move it over the hill. Therefore, .5m was the perfect height for the car rolls over. Finally, we created our stopping part of our roller coaster. When the car has completely stopped, it’s potential energy then became zero. '",

The Kinetic energy at the bottom of the drop will be 5.2J (jewels). Due to the friction on our drop (in the real world) some of the kinetic energy will be changed to heat energy. 0.7 J (jewels), the heat energy will be useless to you, on the drop, so keeping it to a minimum would be wise!

Please say Yes if it defines the concept at the input correctly, otherwise say No. Here is the student paragraph: 'To start off with, our firm chose .6kg as a car mass. One of the reasons is that during the experiments, 2 kg as a car mass reached 2 J for potential energy,.4 kg had 3.9 J for potential energy & .8 had 7.8 J as a potential energy, so for an extra experiment, the car mass of .6 had reached 5.9 J , and 5.9 J seemed to be the perfect number, as the level would be high enough to make it up the hill, and not to take up more money for more track, because it takes P.E. to make it up the hill, as potential energy goes down, kinetic energy goes up, as kinetic energy is the energy of a moving object, an potential energy is the energy an object something potentially has, and since, as the law of conservation proves, since energy cannot be created, nor destroyed, only transferred, P.E. is transferred to become K.E. and with not friction, like in the simulation, k.E. and P.E. would be equal, but adding friction, like in the real life experiments, P.E. and K.K. will be different, so as some of the K.E. is ‘lost’ shall we say, (Not literally, as I said that energy cannot be destroyed, nor created) then it’ll take more P.E. to make it up the hill, but not so much as to have to add more track for it to stop, because adding more track is costly.        The firm chose for the initial drop height to be .8 m, and here’s why. You see, two things can affect the P.E. needed for it to make it up the hill, the car mass, and the lift height. Now, the initial drop affects the P.E. about the same as car mass does, for example, 0.2m=2J, 0.4m=3.9J, 0.6m=5.9J, and 0.8m=7.8J. Did you notice a pattern? It’s the same for mass except it’s kg instead of m, so basically, initial drop affects P.E. just as much as car mass does, but when both are considered, they can create a bigger number, after all, 5+5 is 10, not 5. Anyways, we chose 0.8 as an initial drop, (Let’s label it I.D from now one.) because, it’ll give us enough P.E to make it over the hill, like with the car, plus, in this, we kept and eye on speed, mostly because mass has no effect on speed so we didn’t mention that ; but height affects speed and a high level of speed can be dangerous. For the hill, the firm chose the height to be .6 m as it allowed the car to go over the hill.'",
