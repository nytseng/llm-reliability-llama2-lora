I choose this height because it will have more potential energy to go all over the rollercoaster. During the initial drop, most of the js of PE will be transforming into K.E.E with the loss of heat. I choose 25 meters hill height because the car would have less kinetic energy when going down hill into the stopping point. We could not make the hill taller than the initial drop because of the Law of Conservation of energy, which says energy cannot be created or destroyed. The hill will be good because they are still using energy from the initial drop. The final part of the Pacific Coaster is the stopping portion, ending in water. Potential energy was tranformed into heat energy, instead of K.E.The car will also have a lot more potential energy than a bigger car with a smaller mass. The car mass that I choose was 25kg. I choose this car mass because it won’t be so difficult to take the car to the top of the initial drop and our car had the greatest mass, so that these was the most potential energy as possible. There will not be an increase in speed, even if mass increases because speed increases with an increase in drop height.'",

Please say Yes if it defines the concept at the input correctly, otherwise say No. Here is the student paragraph: 'We chose a height of .8 meters because it is a large drop that has enough potential energy to go through the entire rollercoaster. While testing to find the best drop height we learned that if you increase the height, the amount of potential energy also increases. We took a height of .2 meters and the potential energy was .6 Joules. Then we took a height of .4 meters and we saw that the potential energy increased to 1.2 Joules. This was how we discovered an increase in height gives you a higher potential energy. When you have friction on the initial drop, the potential energy at the top of the hill will NOT equal the kenetic energy at the bottom of the drop. This is because energy is being lost due to heat energy. This drop is an important part of the rollercoaster.'",

I chose this height for the initial drop because 35m wasn’t too long or too short. If the height of the initial drop is low, than won’t have enough potential energy (PE) and the passengers would probably get stuck between the initial drop and the hill. The Law of Conservation of Energy says that no energy can made or destroyed. So the initial drop had  to have more than enough Potential energy to get over the loop and hills. Potential energy will be less due to  heat. The car would have 4.802J Potential energy but some will be  transformed to heat. If the hill was the same height as the hill or close to the hill height it would not be ideal because the car lost energy. It was transformed to heat energy. '",

We have the great rollar coaster called Hoppolia! This is Icelandic for jumping in puddlies.We will have an elevator for people to get to the top. This will be efficient, because many people can fit on one elevator. Elevators are also very safe, because people can’t fall out and they have good speed. To spice the elevator up we can decorate it very creepy + have scary music play!Initial drop: To make sure our coaster can be fast we have the drop at 97 meters. It won’t take a lot of energy. The hight is good, because there will be gravity forces pushing down on people to keep them in there car. People will love this part not just for the stomach flip felling, but also the high speed! This rollar coaster will go about 30 m/s^2.loop: The loop is always everyone’s favorite part! This loop will be like no other! It will be so much fun no one know what hit them! There will be some room between the initial drop + the loop to slow things down. By the time it hits the loop it will be totally epic! This part will be coast cost effective because it is less expensive to buy. The loop diamiter will be 35 meters.hill: My hill is ment to give the riders that last stomach drop give the coaster the energy it needs to end the ride. The hight of the hill hight will be 27 meters high. This hight will be best to push it to the end + to make it fun! This is not to fast but fast enough. The car will still be going fairly fast from the loop, so rides can look forward to the fast hill too!At the end of the coaster, there will be water to stop in! No one will be expecting it, so its a nice surprise at the end! It won’t be like they drop into a tank of water, it’s just like a push to slow it down.  This is a good way to stop, because water will make it stop sooner!We hope you like your perpocil!,.'",

The initial drop height is 1.0m; it’s the right amount for the rollercoaster car to drop safely and enought height for the potential energy to conver to kinetic energy. We should not start out with the height limit. Hill Height is 30 m, because the hill should be smaller than the initial drop height, so it can accomplish getting on the other side. The hill gives the rollercoaster car will enough potential energy. My rollercoaster blueprint might be a perfect idea because it has the right amount of mass, the right hill height, the right hill which is gradual and the correct measurement of the initial drop. The car mass is 0.5 which is the right amount for a 1 meter initial drop height height. Final dimensions: Potential and  Kinetic Energy is summed up into 2 J'",

For the initial drop height was .98 meters because it built a lot of Potential energy and transferred that to kinetic energy when going down. When you have a steep drop it has more Potential energy at the top to change into Kinetic energy when it is going down. The coaster car has a mass of 0.5kg. On the top the Potential energy was 2.5 Joules, + on the bottom of the drop the Kienetic energy was 2.5 Joules. Both the energys at the top and bottom are still the same though due to the law of conservation of energy .  I also gave the hill some height differences. For the hill, I decided to put the height to about 0.3m to give some height difference so that there would be enough speed to go over the hill and also would give the customers more thrill through speed.'",

Please say Yes if it defines the concept at the input correctly, otherwise say No. Here is the student paragraph: 'This is the roller coaster design that I have created. This roller coaster has an initial drop along with a hill before it comes to a stop. It has an initial height of 1m and is enough to build the feeling of suspense just before the ride drops down. The cart has a mass of 0.5kg and I specifically choose this because it is not to heavy or too light. That way, the customers will not feel as if they are going to get thrown out of the ride. At the lift of the ride. The following energy principle can be seen below. The formula gives the value that the kinetic energy is directly proportional to the potential energy. All kinetic energy as it is going to the highest point at the lift will be converted to potential energy. At the highest point, the potential energy is equivalent to 5J.  At the drop point, the customers would scream and yell the most. The potential energy is being converted to kinetic energy at this instance. This means that the roller coaster will speed up as you are going down the track. The kinetic energy gained from the first height allows the cart to obtain enough energy for it to pass through the first hill. The first hill has a height of 0.43m. To make sure that the cart passes through this height.        The kinetic energy achieved from the first drop must be bigger than the potential energy required for the first hill. If the energy is not enough, then the roller coaster will not be able to get over the height of the hill. The customers should feel as if they are inside a plane experiencing bumpiness as the the roller coaster is going up and down. This should be a great design for the amusement park ride. '",

The design centers around allowing the passengers to experience the extreme drops. Using only potential and kinetic energy, the car is given enough kinetic and potential energy initially to carry it through the whole ride. The car will sit at the top of an initial drop that is 100 meteres high and then is allowed to fall down the slope of the initial drop.  As it rolls down the slope, the potential energy is converted into KE. As it reaches the bottom of the drop, though, the riders to experience the most thrilling aspect of the ride, and the kinetic energy of the car will carry it along the to the end. The car slows down as it approaches a small hill. At the peak, the converts most of its energy into PE. Then, it quickly accelerates downhill, turing back into KE for the passengers. After reaching the bottom of the hill, the car will slow down and stop to allow the passengers to get out.
