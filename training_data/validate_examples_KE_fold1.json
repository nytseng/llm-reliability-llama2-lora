I choose 25 meters hill height because the car would have less kinetic energy when going down hill into the stopping point. We could not make the hill taller than the initial drop because of the Law of Conservation of energy, which says energy cannot be created or destroyed. The hill will be good because they are still using energy from the initial drop. The final part of the Pacific Coaster is the stopping portion, ending in water. Potential energy was tranformed into heat energy, instead of K.E.The car will also have a lot more potential energy than a bigger car with a smaller mass. The car mass that I choose was 25kg. I choose this car mass because it won’t be so difficult to take the car to the top of the initial drop and our car had the greatest mass, so that these was the most potential energy as possible. There will not be an increase in speed, even if mass increases because speed increases with an increase in drop height.'",

The drop converts all the stored potential energy into kinetic energy, giving it enough speed for the people to get thrill and enjoy. The more potential energy you have, the more energy you will have for the rest of the ride, which was our goal. In the initial drop, we took the Potential Energy and transformed it to Kinetic Energy. At the top, there is no Kinetic Energy because all the Potential Energy has yet to transform into Kinetic Energy. The higher the initial drop height got, the more potential energy you had.  Also, all the potential energy had transformed into Kinetic energy. Also, when the mass went up, so did the potential energy. This means, the more mass you have, the more potential energy you will have. Also, mass doesn’t affect speed.The Hill It has a height of 0.42m. to give the thrill to the people, by slowing down the ride while going up, and speeding it back up when it goes down. The principle involved is again the energy principle, as kinetic energy is partially converted into potential energy while going up and then this potential energy is again converted into kinetic energy.

More Kinetic Energy means more speed. The drop starts out with a larger number of Potential Energy. All that Potential Energy is eventually turned into Kinetic Energy, and since there is a lot of Potential energy, there is a lot of Kinetic Energy.'",

If you increase the car mass then the amount of Potential energy and kinetic energy will also increase. We choose the drop height to be .8m because then it will have enough energy to go over .7m hill and a loop with a radius .2m. The greater the drop height the greater the PE, and KE. When the height was .2m there was .8J of PE at the top but there we increased the height to .4m the PE at the top was 1.6 J. We choose this drop height because the greater the drop height the greater PE and KE. When we choose .8 meters to be our drop height to make it fun but also safe. When we did .8 m in the simulation with a mass of .4kg it didn’t go over 40 m/s/s. Because the law of conversation of energy says that energy cannot be created or destroyed we had to choose appropriate drop height to get it over the hills and around the loop. When the car goes down the drop the Potiental energy is changed to KE because PE= m*h*9.8 and KE=m*1/2*v^2. As the hill height increases PE, KE increases. The hill height is higher than the initial drop then it will not have enough energy to make it over the hill. If you increase the hill height the PE increases at the top and so does the KE at the bottom. We choose a hill height of .7m because our drop height was .8m. There would only be KE at the bottom of the rollarcoaster because KE = m*1/2 *v.^2 and it has nothing to do with height but PE = m*h*. 9.8 so that is why PE i effected by height.'",

On the top the Potential energy was 2.5 Joules, + on the bottom of the drop the Kienetic energy was 2.5 Joules. Both the energys at the top and bottom are still the same though due to the law of conservation of energy .  I also gave the hill some height differences. For the hill, I decided to put the height to about 0.3m to give some height difference so that there would be enough speed to go over the hill and also would give the customers more thrill through speed.'",

So increasing any one of those variables will cause the possible energy, Potential, to increase. Same with decreasing also with changing of height speed will change as well.

My corporation decided to use 0.5kg because, we didn’t want it to be 0.8kg because it would be harder to get it up the hill. The initial drop provides the kinetic energy 100%, required to get the car over the hill, and to the gate. Its one meter tall, so having a tall height means more potential energy at the top. The total energy was 4.9 Joules. Having more energy means you can have more to the rollercoaster because it has more energy to lose.The initial drop is fun because of the high height.

We decided to put the initial drop up one more level to 1 meter. To make sure that it is safe, my group and I tested it with the simulation. My group and I chose the hill height to be 0.8 meters for a few reasons. First of all, we tried to make the hill smaller then the initial drop. The results of that ( we tried .4 m) were bad because the speed was too high. Then we had the hill be .6 meters. But that wasn’t;t too good. Then we tried .8 meters which had an red flags for the speed. That made us decide that this was best.'",

When we did 0.8kg and 0.6kg, it took a lot to go over the hill. We tested out mass and what would be a good enough mass for the car and decided to go along with .4 kg for mass because if it was bigger it would have too much weight and not enough speed. The initial drop height of 1m was chosen because it gives enough speed to go over the track. It wouldn’t be to high so that it would go over the maximum speed limit.  When the car goes up, it gains Potential Energy because as it stops at the initial drop it is at it’s greatest and goes down while Kinetic Energy goes up when the car goes down the drop. The hills will be shorter than the initial drop. 0.6m was the chosen hill height.

Unlike the height of 0.6m which only has a potential energy of 2.9 J, it has more potential energy when it is higher.        The hill height chosen was 0.43 m.

Please say Yes if it defines the concept at the input correctly, otherwise say No. Here is the student paragraph: 'The first thing we had to decide was the mass. Our team decided on a mass of .74kg. We chose that mass because we didn't want it to be too heavy because then it wouldn't be able to make it over the loops. When mass was .2kg the Potential energy at the top was 2J, and then we increased the mass to .4kg the potential energy increased to 3.9J. The mass of .74kg isn't too high to be unsafe because if Potential energy was too high the car would go down the hill. When the lift height increased by .2m the potential energy increased at the same rate as it did for mass. There will not be an increase in speed, even if mass increases because speed increases with an increase in drop height. With a mass of .74kg and a height of 1m the car will be able to make it over a surface with friction.         The next thing we decided on was the initial drop height, and our company chose 1m. With a higher height the car will go faster. Both potential energy, at the top, and kinetic energy, at the bottom, increased with a higher height. They increased by 2J every time the height went up by .2m. The total energy is the Potential energy plus the Kinetic energy, so that also increased. Potential energy is highest at the top of the drop because it's energy at rest. Kinetic energy is highest at the bottom because it's energy at motion. Energy can't be created or destroyed but can change it's form. When there's friction it creates heat so if there was Friction on the drop then potential energy would stay the same since friction doesn't affect it. Friction would decrease Kinetic energy.         The third thing the team decided on was the hill height. We chose a height of .62m. We wanted to make it high for more fun, but if it was any heigher the car wouldn't have enough energy to make it over. If our hill height was heigher than the initial drop there's mo way the car would make it over. The car wouldn't have energy to make it over a hill heigher than the initial drop because since energy cannot be created the amount of energy you have from the initial drop will stay the for the hill. you can't create more energy to get over a higher hill.
