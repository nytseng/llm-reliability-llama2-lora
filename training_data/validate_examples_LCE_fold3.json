PE is related to the mass and height. The law of conservation of energy states that energy can’t be made or destroyed. Some of the energy turns into heat energy or different energies. If you add all the energies up they should still equal the starting energy. Our hill height was .5m. It was that height because if it was higher than the drop (.77m) then it wouldn’t have enough energy to get up. It couldn’t be .77m because it loses some energy. '",

The initial drop height is 1.0m; it’s the right amount for the rollercoaster car to drop safely and enought height for the potential energy to conver to kinetic energy. We should not start out with the height limit. Hill Height is 30 m, because the hill should be smaller than the initial drop height, so it can accomplish getting on the other side. The hill gives the rollercoaster car will enough potential energy. My rollercoaster blueprint might be a perfect idea because it has the right amount of mass, the right hill height, the right hill which is gradual and the correct measurement of the initial drop. The car mass is 0.5 which is the right amount for a 1 meter initial drop height height. Final dimensions: Potential and  Kinetic Energy is summed up into 2 J'",

After the initial drop the car moves into the .4 meter loop height. As the car goes up the loop and up the hill, the potential energy is increasing. As it is going down the initial drop, comes out of the loop, and goes down the hill, the kinetic energy was increasing.We noticed that as height would increase the energy  gained.

Please say Yes if it defines the concept at the input correctly, otherwise say No. Here is the student paragraph: 'Our group decided to lift our car to a height of 0.9 meters using a conveyor belt method. We chose this mass because more mass means more potential energy. This can be proven by the formula for potential energy which is 9.8 x mass x height. This is also why we chose to have a high initial drop height. The reason we want more potential energy is because of the Law of Conservation of Energy. This states that energy can’t be created or destroyed in a system. We didn’t want our mass to be too heavy. Initial Drop The initial drop height is 0.9 meters, a high height to increase the potential energy. Kinetic energy is velocity^2x1/2xmass. So, if mass stays constant and kinetic energy increases, velocity must increase. We get this kinetic energy because potential energy turns into kinetic energy. But, since our roller coaster does not have friction all potential energy turns into kinetic, making it faster. Hill/loopWe chose a hill height of 0.5 meters. We chose this height because the hill can’t be taller than the initial drop according to the Law of Conservation of Energy.'",

This roller coaster will consist of the highest point followed by a drop back to the lowest point and then a small hill which makes the ride fun. The ride proposed is fun as the big differences in height from the falls make people feel adrenaline therefore, they will feel different but in a good way. Also, it is safe as there are friction controllers on the ride to make the cart slow down whenever it is reaching high points so that it stays on track and safe. The first part of the track is the initial drop, which is a the maximum height. The car at the top is positions to go down the ramp. At this point the potential energy is at its maximum which means that the cart must have not be moving. So, once the cart slides, it goes down the drop. This makes it safer for everyone as it avoids risks of going out of the ride. Then, at the bottom the cart is at its maximum kinetic energy and 0 potential as it is at ground level. Then, there is a hill where the cart reaches a maximum height lower than the previous one. In this part the cart slows down as it reaches the maximum height were its kinetic energy is 0 again. And as it rolls down, it loses all of its potential energy and regains the kinetic. Finally, the cart slow down rapidly without hurting anybody as the cart slows down without breaking forcefully. For this reasons, the ride seems completely safe and adequate for people to ride it and enjoy it.'",

Please say Yes if it defines the concept at the input correctly, otherwise say No. Here is the student paragraph: 'I have recently designed a rollercoaster for your park to benefit your visitors. It involves a drop and a hill. For the mass of the cart,  I chose the mass of the cart to be 0.5 kg so it would not be too massive to prevent passengers from riding, but not to light to the point where the cart travels too fast the flies off the track. The beginning part of the coaster consists of a track at the top of an initial drop. The cart reaches the top- a safe height that also allows for fast speeds. The higher the cart is placed, the more potential energy is has that can be transformed into kinetic energy which makes the cart travel faster. This height is large enough for a very fast speed but is still safe for the riders. As the car drops, all of the cart’s potential energy turns into kinetic energy that speeds up the cart. The cart goes down the track making it one of the more exciting parts of the ride. The third part of the track involves a curve and a hill, which is 0.4 m high, the cart climbs and then goes over. This part of the track is frictionless so the cart can move faster without being slowed down. This allows the kinetic energy of the cart coming down the initial drop to be transformed into potential energy as the cart climbs the hill. This gained potential energy will immediately be turned into kinetic energy as the cart slides back down the final hill, increasing the speed of the cart, and making it a fun, fast-paced ride. No friction could be a concern because the cart could go to fast This is compensated by the height of the hill. As the hill gets higher, the chances of the cart reaching these dangerous speeds would be less. To implement this coaster in your amusement park, a large scale-up would be needed to create this simulation on a real, much larger scale. '",

The car of this height will have a good amount of potential energy. If the height of the initial drop increases, then the speed of the car will be greater. The car lift is efficient because here mass of our car is 50kg which means that the potential energy  is high. The potential and kinetic energy increases as mass increases. For the initial drop, the amount of Kinetic energy at the bottom is close to the amount of potential energy at the top. The potential energy that doesn’t change into kinetic energy turns into heat energy. This happens because our roller coaster has friction. As the height of the initial drop or the mass of the car raises the potential energy raises too. The next part to our rollercoasters is the hill. The height we chose for the hill was 50m tall. The final part of our roller coaster is the stopping section. The car comes into the stopping section with a relatively high speed.'",

This is enough energy to make it over the hill which is 0.5 m. We also picked this height because of the speed at the bottem of the hill which is 4.43 m/s. Also the K.E. Is 3.9J. The third part of the Rollar Coaster is the hill. We made the hill 0.5 m tall. We made it this height so it would be tall enough to be fun, but short enough so the car can get over it. The last part of your Rollar Coaster was the long stretch that would bring the car to a stop. The stopping distance isn’t effected by mass, but height does.

As the car goes down the drop it gains KE, if it gains ke it goes faster the drop is 1 m because if it was any lower it’s slower. As the height of the initial drop increases so does the ke at the bottom well as speed. The chosen height of the hill is .5m.
