While testing to find the best drop height we learned that if you increase the height, the amount of potential energy also increases. We took a height of .2 meters and the potential energy was .6 Joules. Then we took a height of .4 meters and we saw that the potential energy increased to 1.2 Joules. This was how we discovered an increase in height gives you a higher potential energy. When you have friction on the initial drop, the potential energy at the top of the hill will NOT equal the kenetic energy at the bottom of the drop. This is because energy is being lost due to heat energy. This drop is an important part of the rollercoaster.'",

The car would have to make it up the 100 meter tall initial drop. I chose this height because it is large enough to get a large amount of potential energy-going back to the formula for potential energy. The car’s potential energy will turn into kinetic energy, but the systems total amount of energy will always be the same according to the law of conservation of energy. Loss of kinetic energy will cause the car to slow down. The car will not go all the way back up  the other side of the U because at the top of the U the car will have a certain number of joules of potential energy. The car will get kinetic energy as it starts to move down the U. '",

You see, originally we were going to have the coaster car weigh 0.2 kilograms, which would only give the coaster car to have 3.321 more Joules of energy, which definetly helps. The amount of kinetic energy was 4.2 Joules at the bottom of the drop. The potential energy at the top of the hill is 3.1Joules. the kinetic energy to be at 3. Joules.It will be 0.8 meters of the top of the drop, and 0.8 meters from start to the bottom of the highest point. Next, the car will go down it’s initial drop. Because the height is so high but the mass is so high, they will mostly balance out to the cars potential energy making it rise a little. The car will then go faster. It rises due to kinetic energy, which is converted from potential energy. As I said before, potential energy would be higher, around 3.1 Joules, because of the drop’s height. For instance, in a height with a 0.4 meter drop height, the potential energy was around 1.6 Joules, so less with a lesser height.'",

This roller coaster will consist of the highest point followed by a drop back to the lowest point and then a small hill which makes the ride fun. The ride proposed is fun as the big differences in height from the falls make people feel adrenaline therefore, they will feel different but in a good way. Also, it is safe as there are friction controllers on the ride to make the cart slow down whenever it is reaching high points so that it stays on track and safe. The first part of the track is the initial drop, which is a the maximum height. The car at the top is positions to go down the ramp. At this point the potential energy is at its maximum which means that the cart must have not be moving. So, once the cart slides, it goes down the drop. This makes it safer for everyone as it avoids risks of going out of the ride. Then, at the bottom the cart is at its maximum kinetic energy and 0 potential as it is at ground level. Then, there is a hill where the cart reaches a maximum height lower than the previous one. In this part the cart slows down as it reaches the maximum height were its kinetic energy is 0 again. And as it rolls down, it loses all of its potential energy and regains the kinetic. Finally, the cart slow down rapidly without hurting anybody as the cart slows down without breaking forcefully. For this reasons, the ride seems completely safe and adequate for people to ride it and enjoy it.'",

The design centers around allowing the passengers to experience the extreme drops.

The car will sit at the top of an initial drop that is 100 meteres high and then is allowed to fall down the slope of the initial drop.  As it rolls down the slope, the potential energy is converted into KE. As it reaches the bottom of the drop, though, the riders to experience the most thrilling aspect of the ride, and the kinetic energy of the car will carry it along the to the end. The car slows down as it approaches a small hill. At the peak, the converts most of its energy into PE. Then, it quickly accelerates downhill, turing back into KE for the passengers. After reaching the bottom of the hill, the car will slow down and stop to allow the passengers to get out.

Please say Yes if it defines the concept at the input correctly, otherwise say No. Here is the student paragraph: 'The first thing we had to decide was the mass and the lift height. Our team decided on a mass of .74kg and a lift height of 1m. We chose that mass because we didn't want it to be too heavy because then it wouldn't be able to make it over the loops. When mass was .2kg the Potential energy at the top was 2J, and then we increased the mass to .4kg the potential energy increased to 3.9J. The mass of .74kg isn't too high to be unsafe because if Potential energy was too high the car would go down the hill with too much force. The next thing we decided on was the initial drop height, and our company chose 1m. Both potential energy, at the top, and kinetic energy, at the bottom, increased with a higher height. They increased by 2J every time the height went up by .2m. The total energy is the Potential energy plus the Kinetic energy, so that also increased. Potential energy is highest at the top of the drop because it's energy at rest. Kinetic energy is highest at the bottom because it's energy at motion. Energy can't be created or destroyed but can change it's form. The third thing the team decided on was the hill height. We chose a height of .62m. We wanted to make it high for more fun, but if it was any heigher the car wouldn't have enough energy to make it over. If our hill height was heigher than the initial drop there's mo way the car would make it over. The car wouldn't have energy to make it over a hill heigher than the initial drop because since energy cannot be created the amount of energy you have from the initial drop will stay the for the hill. you can't create more energy to get over a higher hill.'",

The height isn’t too high and our car mass isn’t too high. Next, we made our initial drop, which was .77m high. We chose this height because it caused the car to have a lot of potential energy, which is measured in joules. I also knew that when you increase the drop height, you increase the potential energy, which increases the kinetic energy at the end of the drop. A lot of kinetic energy means a lot of motion. The .77m of potential energy turns into kinetic energy and heat energy. The speed increases when your going down the drop. The car gains speed.         After the initial drop comes our hill. We chose to make our hill height .5m high. In my simulation, I tested different hill heights. I found out that if the height is the same or higher than the initial drop height, than the car will not move it over the hill. Therefore, .5m was the perfect height for the car rolls over. Finally, we created our stopping part of our roller coaster. When the car has completely stopped, it’s potential energy then became zero. '",

The hill has a shorter height so you go over it at a higher speed. The hill height is 75m. The hill is near the end of the ride, so at the top of the hill the potential energy is only 1 joule.

The reasoning behind our choice of Car Mass is the reasonable amount of Potential Energy (pe). The more mass the more PE. For example, a 0.4 kg mass resulted in 3.9 J of pe. A greater Car Mass of 0.8 kg resulted in 7.8 J of pe. Compared to the lowest Car Mass of 0.2 kg with the pe 2 J, our chosen car mass had a greater of 3.9 J.It won’t fly off the tracks like the decreased mass.Next we will discuss the Initial Drop Height. We suggest an Initial Drop Height of 1 meter. In our trials as Drop Increased the pe increased as well as speed. For instance, with a Drop Height of 0.4 meters the Initial PE and final ke were 3.9 J. When drop height was doubled to 0.8 meters, initial PE and final yes were 7.8 J. Equal initial pe and final KE showed the law of conservation of energy. The final speed did not change with different car masses. Hill Height will be discussed next. We suggest using the Hill height of 0.5 (m). As the hill height increased, the PE increased at the hill top. The speed at the hill top decreased with greater hill height. For example, a hill height of 0.6 (m) results in a hill top PE of 2.3 J. The PE of this lower hill is slightly less at 1.2 J'",
