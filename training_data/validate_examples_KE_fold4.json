It will be where all of the energy must be created in the form of Potential energy. A height of 90m would be just right because the initial drop can help the car to go over the hills with enough potential energy. I propose that we should make the roller coasters drop 90 meters tall because the roller coaster needs a lot of KE to go through the rest of the roller coaster. During initial drop, the increasing height increases potential energy at the top of hill and kinetic energy at the bottom of hill. When we increase the initial drop height the car has a faster speed so it'll be able to travel farther.The hill of the roller coaster is another critical part. It must be a smaller height than the initial drop to have enough energy to go up the hill. The hill can be .80 meter or less because it can’t be more than .89 meter because the potential energy would be transformed to kinetic energy with the loss of heat.  The hill has this height, the car will have enough Kinetic energy to get it over the hill. When increasing height and mass in car lift, potential energy increased.'",

I chose this height for the initial drop because 35m wasn’t too long or too short. If the height of the initial drop is low, than won’t have enough potential energy (PE) and the passengers would probably get stuck between the initial drop and the hill. The Law of Conservation of Energy says that no energy can made or destroyed. So the initial drop had  to have more than enough Potential energy to get over the loop and hills. Potential energy will be less due to  heat. The car would have 4.802J Potential energy but some will be  transformed to heat. If the hill was the same height as the hill or close to the hill height it would not be ideal because the car lost energy. It was transformed to heat energy. '",

Please say Yes if it defines the concept at the input correctly, otherwise say No. Here is the student paragraph: 'When designing a roller coaster, you want to have a high initial drop. If the height of the initial drop is .65 meter, there will be more potential energy. To be exact, in the simulation, the potential energy was 3.9 joules. When the car moves down the drop, the potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy. But, in the real world, some kinetic energy will be lost to heat energy, but the total amount of energy is the same. This is because of the Law of Conservation of Energy. This law states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. Since the mass is small, this also affects the total energy. This is because more mass means more potential energy and kinetic energy.After this is over, we bring them back up a hill of 0.56 meters, just slightly lower than the initial hill. When they first begin dropping, they will feel a thrill. At the top of the hill, they will experience  the feeling of weightlessness. They wont stay up there long before being shot back down the hill, reaching a fast speed. Finally, after traveling a short distance the brakes will be added to the cart and it will come to a stop, which will give the riders one last feeling of force. Despite all these amazing features, we believe that the best aspect of our design is the fact that it is completely frictionless, so after the drop, no more energy needs to be added to the cart, making it very environmental and economical friendly. The combination of all these thrills will give the riders an experience they will never forget.'",

This roller coaster is the best. Tostart the roller coaster is the initial drop. It will be using a cart that is 5 grams, so their is enough mass to keep the car on track. Right at the top of the initial drop it will hold the cart just so it is at al most 80º Then hold it for 3 to 5 second to make it more intresting The Force used to pull the cart from the bottom to the Top will have to be big enough so it can pull it all the way back threw the track so people can rid it again        The inetial drop like I said the height is .77 meters high Then it will hold at The top for 3 to 5 seconds When it drops it will lossen the pully lines so it will feel like you’r falling  out of the The sky. Whem the cart is droped it will still stay in contact with the track so it does not go off the track and not make it safe at the Bottom it will be a gradual ride to a flat section.         On the hill the hill will not have way to much presure on the people on the ride so they would get supper hurt or even die. the hills height will be .5 meters high and have it be in like a black hole leading up to it then fly down the other side of the hill Then Their will be a slight flat section going to the loop.         Right when you get to the loop Their will be the track that has the end of the loop where you go from when you start To get on the loop and then when you get off the loop it will kinda be like a train changing lanes to go a different direction. The loop height will be .24 meters in height and diamiter ad when it gets to the loop it will have enough volocity To keep it from getting stuck at the top then falling out then not making it safe.         When The cart is don with the loop the caret will be stoping in ashort amount of timeThe amount of energy will be all taken away when it comes to the landing strip and that will be a section  When They get to a complete stop The cart will go back to the begaing but fast.

Please say Yes if it defines the concept at the input correctly, otherwise say No. Here is the student paragraph: 'Our rollercoaster has came to a final design proposal. First of all, lets start at the initial drop. We decided to make the car be lifted up 90m. This height is good because the car will have a good amount of potential energy that will allow the car to get over the hill. Another reason we chose a high initial drop height is when height increases, there is an increase in speed. the mass of our car is 50kg. The initial drop is perfect because the amount of Kinetic energy at the bottom isn’t too close to the amount of potential energy at the top. The potential energy that doesn’t change into kinetic energy turns into heat energy. The initial drop is also good because the drop height is 90m high. If we would’ve made the initial drop any higher it would’ve been too much because as the height of the initial drop or the mass of the car  raises the potential energy raises too. This happens because the formula for potential energy is mass x height x gravity. The initial drop has the amount of potential energy changing into kinetic energy doesn’t have a big difference in the number of Juoles. this happens because the formula for Kinetic energy is 1/2 x m x v^2. The next part to our rollercoasters is the hill and loop. The height we chose for the hill was 50m tall'",

Please say Yes if it defines the concept at the input correctly, otherwise say No. Here is the student paragraph: 'The car will weigh 50 kilograms. The lift stands 95 meters tall. The car gains potential energy as it climbs. This energy has the potential of being used at the climax of the lift. It will be used. Since the height of the lift is so tall we made the car have less mass. The car’s next step is the drop.  As the car makes its way down, the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, its active energy that is moving the car. As the car goes down, all potential energy is converted into kinetic energy when there is no friction.The hill is another part of the ride. It is 0.35 meters tall. The Potential energy at the top of the hill was two Joules. Potential energy was calculated by mass*height*g. The Kienetic energy at the hill base was 2.9 Joules. This was calculated by 1/2*mass*velocity^2.'",

Please say Yes if it defines the concept at the input correctly, otherwise say No. Here is the student paragraph: 'In my roller coaster, I made the initial drop height 0.96 meters tall. I choose this height because it is very tall, giving the car a lot of potential energy. Potential energy is the amount of stored energy an object can use. Potential energy can be converted into kenetic energy, which is the amount of energy an object has in motion. Therefore, if you have a lot of potential energy, you will also get a lot of kenetic energy. This also means that if a rollercoaster has no height, it has no potential energy and if the rollercoaster is not moving, it has no kienetic energy. So, before the rollercoaster goes up the initial drop, it has potential energy or kenetic energy. At the top of the initial drop, it has potential energy but not kenetic energy. You can determine how much potential energy the rollercoaster has by using the formula PE=m•g•h (PE=potential energy, m=mass, g=9.8(acceleration due to gravity) and h=height of hill.) If you use this formula, you will find out that my rollercoaster has 0.083 Jewls of energy at the top of the initial drop. (My mass was 0.00866 kilograms.) This rule applies to all parts of the rollercoaster. Another reason we chose a high initial drop height is when height increases, there is an increase in speed.        After the rollercoaster goes down the initial drop.  I choose the hill height of 0.32 meters because of the Law of Conservation of Energy. This law says that energy can’t be created or destroyed. I used two things to stop the rollercoaster: friction and the Law of Concervation of Energy. I used an incline of 0.16 meters tall at the very end of the rollercoaster so that the rollercoaster will go up the incline and fall back because it won’t have enough energy to make it all the way to the top. I chose this method of stopping because it doesn’t require a lot of track to stop.         In conclusion, my rollercoaster has a lot of potential energy when it has a lot of mass and height and a lot of kienetic energy when it is in motion. My rollercoaster follows the Law of Concervation of Energy.'",

Please say Yes if it defines the concept at the input correctly, otherwise say No. Here is the student paragraph: 'I have recently designed a rollercoaster for your park to benefit your visitors. It involves a drop and a hill. For the mass of the cart,  I chose the mass of the cart to be 0.5 kg so it would not be too massive to prevent passengers from riding, but not to light to the point where the cart travels too fast the flies off the track. The beginning part of the coaster consists of a track at the top of an initial drop. The cart reaches the top- a safe height that also allows for fast speeds. The higher the cart is placed, the more potential energy is has that can be transformed into kinetic energy which makes the cart travel faster. This height is large enough for a very fast speed but is still safe for the riders. As the car drops, all of the cart’s potential energy turns into kinetic energy that speeds up the cart. The cart goes down the track making it one of the more exciting parts of the ride. The third part of the track involves a curve and a hill, which is 0.4 m high, the cart climbs and then goes over. This part of the track is frictionless so the cart can move faster without being slowed down. This allows the kinetic energy of the cart coming down the initial drop to be transformed into potential energy as the cart climbs the hill. This gained potential energy will immediately be turned into kinetic energy as the cart slides back down the final hill, increasing the speed of the cart, and making it a fun, fast-paced ride. No friction could be a concern because the cart could go to fast This is compensated by the height of the hill. As the hill gets higher, the chances of the cart reaching these dangerous speeds would be less. To implement this coaster in your amusement park, a large scale-up would be needed to create this simulation on a real, much larger scale. '",

Please say Yes if it defines the concept at the input correctly, otherwise say No. Here is the student paragraph: 'Our firm suggests to use the Car Mass of 0.4 kg. The reasoning behind our choice of Car Mass is the reasonable amount of Potential Energy (pe). For example, a 0.4 kg mass resulted in 3.9 J of pe. A greater Car Mass of 0.8 kg  resulted in 7.8 J of pe. For all of these trials we used a lift height of 1 meter. We suggest an Initial Drop Height of 1 meter. In our trials as Drop Increased the pe increased. For instance, with a Drop Height of 0.4 meters the Initial PE and final ke were 3.9 J. Equal initial pe and final KE showed the law of conservation of energy. As the hill height increased, the PE increased at the hill top. Our chosen hill height was safer than a lower hill height, because the speed at the top was less. For example, a hill height of 0.6 (m) results in a hill top PE of 2.3 J . The PE of this lower hill is slightly less at 1.2 J. The ke at hill base was also similar due to the lack of friction (3.9J), as was (the) ke at hill top (1.6J).'",
