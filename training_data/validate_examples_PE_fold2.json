Initial drop height: 1,000 meters- I choose this height for the initial drop because this is the right measurement. Hill height: 80- I choose this height because when the car comes from the initial drop it has enough speed to go to the top of the hill. The car is connected to the conveyor belt which lowers the amount of Potential Energy being transferred into Heat Energy. More Potential Energy means more Kinetic Energy. More Kinetic Energy means more speed. The drop starts out with a larger number of Potential Energy. All that Potential Energy is eventually turned into Kinetic Energy, and since there is a lot of Potential energy, there is a lot of Kinetic Energy.'",

Please say Yes if it defines the concept at the input correctly, otherwise say No. Here is the student paragraph: 'Our rollercoaster has came to a final design proposal. First of all, lets start at the initial drop. We decided to make the car be lifted up 90m. This height is good because the car will have a good amount of potential energy that will allow the car to get over the hill. Another reason we chose a high initial drop height is when height increases, there is an increase in speed. the mass of our car is 50kg. The initial drop is perfect because the amount of Kinetic energy at the bottom isn’t too close to the amount of potential energy at the top. The potential energy that doesn’t change into kinetic energy turns into heat energy. The initial drop is also good because the drop height is 90m high. If we would’ve made the initial drop any higher it would’ve been too much because as the height of the initial drop or the mass of the car  raises the potential energy raises too. This happens because the formula for potential energy is mass x height x gravity. The initial drop has the amount of potential energy changing into kinetic energy doesn’t have a big difference in the number of Juoles. this happens because the formula for Kinetic energy is 1/2 x m x v^2. The next part to our rollercoasters is the hill and loop. The height we chose for the hill was 50m tall'",

I selected a height of .96 meters for my car lift. This way my car can have more potential Energy (PE= m• g • h). By having more potential energy, it means that more can be transformed into kienetic Energy. So, as a result more of the potential energy will turn into kinetic energy, Rather than Heat Energy.           Being that the height of my roller coaster is so highheight, it creates more potential energy, because there is more height. my roller coaster has 0.00815J of energy that can be used later on during roller coaster. After the Initial drop my roller coaster ended with about the same amount of Joules of Energy. All the energy forms added up to 0.00815 Joules of Energy. This is stated in the Law of Conservation of Energy, that no energy can be created or destroyed. '",

Please say Yes if it defines the concept at the input correctly, otherwise say No. Here is the student paragraph: 'I am writing this letter to communicate my ideas regarding the roller coaster you want to build for your park. This roller coaster will consist of the highest point followed by a drop back to the lowest point and then a small hill which makes the ride fun. The ride proposed is fun as the big differences in height from the falls make people feel adrenaline therefore, they will feel different but in a good way. Also, it is safe as there are friction controllers on the ride to make the cart slow down whenever it is reaching high points so that it stays on track and safe. The first part of the track is the initial drop, which is a the maximum height. The car at the top is positions to go down the ramp. At this point the potential energy is at its maximum which means that the cart must have not be moving. So, once the cart slides, it goes down the drop. This makes it safer for everyone as it avoids risks of going out of the ride. Then, at the bottom the cart is at its maximum kinetic energy and 0 potential as it is at ground level. Then, there is a hill where the cart reaches a maximum height lower than the previous one. In this part the cart slows down as it reaches the maximum height were its kinetic energy is 0 again. And as it rolls down, it loses all of its potential energy and regains the kinetic. Finally, the cart slow down rapidly without hurting anybody as the cart slows down without breaking forcefully. For this reasons, the ride seems completely safe and adequate for people to ride it and enjoy it.'",

The next topic the firm chose was the hill. We picked 0.69 for our hill height. I noticed that P.E at top K.E at top and K.E at bottem were the same through all the trials. '",

Please say Yes if it defines the concept at the input correctly, otherwise say No. Here is the student paragraph: 'When the height increases the PE will increase and the KE increases. If you increase the car mass then the amount of potential energy and kinetic energy increases. We choose the drop height to be .8m because then it will have enough energy to go over .7m hill. The greater the initial drop height, the greater the PE, and KE. When the height was .2m there was .8J of PE at the top. But there we increased the height to .4m the PE at the top was 1.6 J. We choose this drop height because the greater the drop height the greater the speed. Because the law of conversation of energy says that energy can not be created or destroyed, we had to choose a aporiate drop height to get it over the hills. When the car goes down the drop the Potiental energy is changed to KE. As the hill height increases, PE and KE increases. It the hill height is higher then the initial drop then it will not have enough speed to make it over the hill. If you increase the hill height the PE increases at the top and so does the KE at the bottom. We choose a hill height of .7m because our drop height was .8m. There would only be KE at the bottom of the rollarcoaster because the formula shows that it has nothing to do with height, but PE was effected by height. '",

The hill height is 14 meters. In the stopping, the friction will make the car’s kinetic energy turn into heat energy, but the systems total amount of energy will always be the same according to the law of conservation of energy.

Having more energy means you can have more to the rollercoaster because it has more energy to lose. It will have a high speed.        The hill has a shorter height so you go over it at a higher speed. The hill height is 75m. The hill is near the end of the ride, so at the top of the hill the potential energy is only 1 joule. The higher hill height gives a higher speed. Through all of this the car mass was .5 kg.
