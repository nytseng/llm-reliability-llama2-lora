I choose 25 meters hill height because the car would have less kinetic energy when going down hill into the stopping point. We could not make the hill taller than the initial drop because of the Law of Conservation of energy, which says energy cannot be created or destroyed. The hill will be good because they are still using energy from the initial drop. The final part of the Pacific Coaster is the stopping portion, ending in water. Potential energy was tranformed into heat energy, instead of K.E.The car will also have a lot more potential energy than a bigger car with a smaller mass. The car mass that I choose was 25kg. I choose this car mass because it won’t be so difficult to take the car to the top of the initial drop and our car had the greatest mass, so that these was the most potential energy as possible. There will not be an increase in speed, even if mass increases because speed increases with an increase in drop height.'",

A height of 90m would be just right because the initial drop can help the car to go over the hills with enough potential energy. I propose that we should make the roller coasters drop 90 meters tall because the roller coaster needs a lot of KE to go through the rest of the roller coaster. During initial drop, the increasing height increases potential energy at the top of hill and kinetic energy at the bottom of hill. When we increase the initial drop height the car has a faster speed so it'll be able to travel farther.The hill of the roller coaster is another critical part. It must be a smaller height than the initial drop to have enough energy to go up the hill. The hill can be .80 meter or less because it can’t be more than .89 meter because the potential energy would be transformed to kinetic energy with the loss of heat.  The hill has this height, the car will have enough Kinetic energy to get it over the hill. When increasing height and mass in car lift, potential energy increased.'",

Potential energy will be less due to  heat. The car would have 4.802J Potential energy but some will be  transformed to heat.

Please say Yes if it defines the concept at the input correctly, otherwise say No. Here is the student paragraph: 'When designing a roller coaster, you want to have a high initial drop. If the height of the initial drop is .65 meter, there will be more potential energy. To be exact, in the simulation, the potential energy was 3.9 joules. When the car moves down the drop, the potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy. But, in the real world, some kinetic energy will be lost to heat energy, but the total amount of energy is the same. This is because of the Law of Conservation of Energy. This law states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. Since the mass is small, this also affects the total energy. This is because more mass means more potential energy and kinetic energy.After this is over, we bring them back up a hill of 0.56 meters, just slightly lower than the initial hill. When they first begin dropping, they will feel a thrill. At the top of the hill, they will experience  the feeling of weightlessness. They wont stay up there long before being shot back down the hill, reaching a fast speed. Finally, after traveling a short distance the brakes will be added to the cart and it will come to a stop, which will give the riders one last feeling of force. Despite all these amazing features, we believe that the best aspect of our design is the fact that it is completely frictionless, so after the drop, no more energy needs to be added to the cart, making it very environmental and economical friendly. The combination of all these thrills will give the riders an experience they will never forget.'",

If you increase the car mass then the amount of Potential energy and kinetic energy will also increase. We choose the drop height to be .8m because then it will have enough energy to go over .7m hill and a loop with a radius .2m. The greater the drop height the greater the PE, and KE. When the height was .2m there was .8J of PE at the top but there we increased the height to .4m the PE at the top was 1.6 J. We choose this drop height because the greater the drop height the greater PE and KE. When we choose .8 meters to be our drop height to make it fun but also safe. When we did .8 m in the simulation with a mass of .4kg it didn’t go over 40 m/s/s. Because the law of conversation of energy says that energy cannot be created or destroyed we had to choose appropriate drop height to get it over the hills and around the loop. When the car goes down the drop the Potiental energy is changed to KE because PE= m*h*9.8 and KE=m*1/2*v^2. As the hill height increases PE, KE increases. The hill height is higher than the initial drop then it will not have enough energy to make it over the hill. If you increase the hill height the PE increases at the top and so does the KE at the bottom. We choose a hill height of .7m because our drop height was .8m.

If we would’ve made the initial drop any higher it would’ve been too much because as the height of the initial drop or the mass of the car  raises the potential energy raises too. This happens because the formula for potential energy is mass x height x gravity.

I choose this height because it is very tall, giving the car a lot of potential energy. Potential energy is the amount of stored energy an object can use. Potential energy can be converted into kenetic energy, which is the amount of energy an object has in motion. Therefore, if you have a lot of potential energy, you will also get a lot of kenetic energy. This also means that if a rollercoaster has no height, it has no potential energy and if the rollercoaster is not moving, it has no kienetic energy. So, before the rollercoaster goes up the initial drop, it has potential energy or kenetic energy. At the top of the initial drop, it has potential energy but not kenetic energy. You can determine how much potential energy the rollercoaster has by using the formula PE=m•g•h (PE=potential energy, m=mass, g=9.8(acceleration due to gravity) and h=height of hill.) If you use this formula, you will find out that my rollercoaster has 0.083 Jewls of energy at the top of the initial drop. (My mass was 0.00866 kilograms.) This rule applies to all parts of the rollercoaster. Another reason we chose a high initial drop height is when height increases, there is an increase in speed.        After the rollercoaster goes down the initial drop.  I choose the hill height of 0.32 meters because of the Law of Conservation of Energy. This law says that energy can’t be created or destroyed. I used two things to stop the rollercoaster: friction and the Law of Concervation of Energy. I used an incline of 0.16 meters tall at the very end of the rollercoaster so that the rollercoaster will go up the incline and fall back because it won’t have enough energy to make it all the way to the top. I chose this method of stopping because it doesn’t require a lot of track to stop.         In conclusion, my rollercoaster has a lot of potential energy when it has a lot of mass and height and a lot of kienetic energy when it is in motion.

When increasing height, potential Energy will increase too because of the formula, mass•height•gravity=Potential Energy. So increasing any one of those variables will cause the possible energy, Potential, to increase. Same with decreasing also with changing of height speed will change as well. Once you go down the initial drop you will go over the hill of .5m. Lastly, is the car stopping point. It stoped because there wasn’t enough energy to get over the hill. This is because of the conservation of energy, energy cant be created not destroyed.'",

This roller coaster has an initial drop along with a hill before it comes to a stop. It has an initial height of 1m and is enough to build the feeling of suspense just before the ride drops down. The cart has a mass of 0.5kg and I specifically choose this because it is not to heavy or too light. That way, the customers will not feel as if they are going to get thrown out of the ride. At the lift of the ride. The following energy principle can be seen below. The formula gives the value that the kinetic energy is directly proportional to the potential energy. All kinetic energy as it is going to the highest point at the lift will be converted to potential energy. At the highest point, the potential energy is equivalent to 5J.  At the drop point, the customers would scream and yell the most. The potential energy is being converted to kinetic energy at this instance. This means that the roller coaster will speed up as you are going down the track. The kinetic energy gained from the first height allows the cart to obtain enough energy for it to pass through the first hill. The first hill has a height of 0.43m. To make sure that the cart passes through this height.        The kinetic energy achieved from the first drop must be bigger than the potential energy required for the first hill. If the energy is not enough, then the roller coaster will not be able to get over the height of the hill. The customers should feel as if they are inside a plane experiencing bumpiness as the the roller coaster is going up and down. This should be a great design for the amusement park ride. '",

It involves a drop and a hill. For the mass of the cart,  I chose the mass of the cart to be 0.5 kg so it would not be too massive to prevent passengers from riding, but not to light to the point where the cart travels too fast the flies off the track. The beginning part of the coaster consists of a track at the top of an initial drop. The cart reaches the top- a safe height that also allows for fast speeds. The higher the cart is placed, the more potential energy is has that can be transformed into kinetic energy which makes the cart travel faster. This height is large enough for a very fast speed but is still safe for the riders. As the car drops, all of the cart’s potential energy turns into kinetic energy that speeds up the cart. The cart goes down the track making it one of the more exciting parts of the ride. The third part of the track involves a curve and a hill, which is 0.4 m high, the cart climbs and then goes over. This part of the track is frictionless so the cart can move faster without being slowed down. This allows the kinetic energy of the cart coming down the initial drop to be transformed into potential energy as the cart climbs the hill. This gained potential energy will immediately be turned into kinetic energy as the cart slides back down the final hill, increasing the speed of the cart, and making it a fun, fast-paced ride. No friction could be a concern because the cart could go to fast This is compensated by the height of the hill. As the hill gets higher, the chances of the cart reaching these dangerous speeds would be less. To implement this coaster in your amusement park, a large scale-up would be needed to create this simulation on a real, much larger scale. '",

A greater Car Mass of 0.8 kg  resulted in 7.8 J of pe. For all of these trials we used a lift height of 1 meter. We suggest an Initial Drop Height of 1 meter. In our trials as Drop Increased the pe increased. For instance, with a Drop Height of 0.4 meters the Initial PE and final ke were 3.9 J. Equal initial pe and final KE showed the law of conservation of energy. As the hill height increased, the PE increased at the hill top. Our chosen hill height was safer than a lower hill height, because the speed at the top was less. For example, a hill height of 0.6 (m) results in a hill top PE of 2.3 J . The PE of this lower hill is slightly less at 1.2 J. The ke at hill base was also similar due to the lack of friction (3.9J), as was (the) ke at hill top (1.6J).'",

The total energy was 4.9 Joules. Having more energy means you can have more to the rollercoaster because it has more energy to lose.The initial drop is fun because of the high height.

Now, the initial drop affects the P.E. about the same as car mass does, for example, 0.2m=2J, 0.4m=3.9J, 0.6m=5.9J, and 0.8m=7.8J. Did you notice a pattern? It’s the same for mass except it’s kg instead of m, so basically, initial drop affects P.E. just as much as car mass does, but when both are considered, they can create a bigger number, after all, 5+5 is 10, not 5. Anyways, we chose 0.8 as an initial drop, (Let’s label it I.D from now one.) because, it’ll give us enough P.E to make it over the hill, like with the car, plus, in this, we kept and eye on speed, mostly because mass has no effect on speed so we didn’t mention that ; but height affects speed and a high level of speed can be dangerous. For the hill, the firm chose the height to be .6 m as it allowed the car to go over the hill.'",

It is also  because the way our heights are, so if we choose a 1 kg mass and a .8m hill height the car stops at the very top. And that is somewhat frightening for passengers.  So we set our mass for .6kg then it will make our efficiency level 100% because Kenetic Energy was 4.7j, and Potential Energy is 0j. Our initial drop height is .7m that is Average, And if we had .6m drop height our car would not have enouigh energy to get over the hill, while on contrary if we had .8m drop height our car would accel the speed limit on the coaster. Our Hill height is at .6m. We chose this height because our initial Drop height .7m and if we put our hill height at the .7m initial drop height our car will never get over the hill, And if we put it at .5m-4m than our car will exceed the speed limit.

The initial PE and final ke are the same because the Law of Conservation of energy states that energy can’t be created nor destroyed only changed so the Pe slowly changes completely in to ke. Next comes the hill. For the hill height we chose 0.6m. We chose 0.6m because with the initial drop height at 0.8m and the friction of real life the hill could have been a little taller but not much, also with it taller It was way too slow and just barely made it over the hill.

Please say Yes if it defines the concept at the input correctly, otherwise say No. Here is the student paragraph: '0.4 kg. would be the best amount for car mass. To start off with, 0.4 kg would be the best mass for the car because, since the car is lighter than .8 kg. Also, since the initial drop height isn’t too high, you don’t have to decrease the mass anymore. Also, the car is 0.4 kg, which is heavier than 0.2 kg. So at the top of the initial drop, the car will have 3.9 J for the initial potential energy instead of only 2 J. Mass does not affect speed so this doesn’t play a role. 0.4 kg for the car mass doesn’t take as much energy as heavier car masses. And the increased car mass increases KE( the energy of motion), so the car will go fast and create a thrilling experience.One meter would be the best height for the initial drop. First of all, the increased height increases potential energy. So the potential energy at the top of the initial drop with a height of 1m would be 9.8 J. This amount of PE is greater than the .2m height, the .4m height, the .6m height, and the .8m height. The potential energy for those heights were 2 J, 3.9 J, 5.9 J, and 7.8 J. Also, the KE at the bottom of the drop was increased also for 1 m as the height. The KE was 9.8 J. This amount of KE is greater than the other heights. The KE at the bottom of those hill heights was only 2 J, 3.9 J, 5.9 J, and 7.9 J. Lastly, the Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed but can be transfered to different dorms. This relates to the initial drop height because the height needs to be tall enough so the car has enough energy to go over the hill. If the initial drop height was increased any more, the car would go to fast.0.5 m would be the best height for the hill. One reason this height is the best is because 0.5 m is not tall than the initial drop height (1m) so the car has enough energy (about 4 J) to make it over the hill. If the hill was taller, say, 1m, and the initial drop was also 1m, than the car wouldn’t be able to make it over the hill. This also is related to Law of Conservation of Energy because energy cannot be created in the car to go over the hill. The initial drop builds up energy in the car, but if the car doesn’t have enough energy, it cannot be created.'",

Another reason is that there is not too much ke or PE going up and down and on the hill is not weighted down. So much that it can’t make it over. The chosen drop height is 1m. As the car goes down the drop it gains KE, if it gains ke it goes faster the drop is 1 m because if it was any lower it’s slower. As the height of the initial drop increases so does the ke at the bottom well as speed. The chosen height of the hill is .5m. The potential energy at the top of the hill is not too great for it and the ke off the other side is just right so the car can be stopped. rt enough for the car to stop and for expenses to be reasonable.'",

The mass can’t be that big because then there will be a lot of energy trying to pull the car up.For the initial drop height my team choose 1m because in previous trials we tried 0.2m-0.8m. then we tried 1m and through each trial the K.E., P.E. and total energy, were the same. So basically it doesn’t matter what the height is. The initial drop provides the kinetic energy 100%, required to have enough energy to get the car over the hill, and to the gate. This would give the car enough energy to go over a hill that is 0.6m high. My corporation chose 0.6m for the hill height. It could not be higher than the initial drop to go over the track. '",

The company chose this height because it is high enough to reach a  good amount of P.E. at 3.9 J which will create a speed to go over the track, but with the kinetic energy of 3.9 J, that the P.E. from the drop  transferred into, the riders are safe from going off track. Unlike the height of 0.6m which only has a potential energy of 2.9 J, it has more potential energy when it is higher.        The hill height chosen was 0.43 m. We chose this because it coincides well. Since an object in motion stays in motion, the car won’t change speed going over the hill and could easily stop or fly off track which this height prevents.

Please say Yes if it defines the concept at the input correctly, otherwise say No. Here is the student paragraph: 'The first thing we had to decide was the mass. Our team decided on a mass of .74kg. We chose that mass because we didn't want it to be too heavy because then it wouldn't be able to make it over the loops. When mass was .2kg the Potential energy at the top was 2J, and then we increased the mass to .4kg the potential energy increased to 3.9J. The mass of .74kg isn't too high to be unsafe because if Potential energy was too high the car would go down the hill. When the lift height increased by .2m the potential energy increased at the same rate as it did for mass. There will not be an increase in speed, even if mass increases because speed increases with an increase in drop height. With a mass of .74kg and a height of 1m the car will be able to make it over a surface with friction.         The next thing we decided on was the initial drop height, and our company chose 1m. With a higher height the car will go faster. Both potential energy, at the top, and kinetic energy, at the bottom, increased with a higher height. They increased by 2J every time the height went up by .2m. The total energy is the Potential energy plus the Kinetic energy, so that also increased. Potential energy is highest at the top of the drop because it's energy at rest. Kinetic energy is highest at the bottom because it's energy at motion. Energy can't be created or destroyed but can change it's form. When there's friction it creates heat so if there was Friction on the drop then potential energy would stay the same since friction doesn't affect it. Friction would decrease Kinetic energy.         The third thing the team decided on was the hill height. We chose a height of .62m. We wanted to make it high for more fun, but if it was any heigher the car wouldn't have enough energy to make it over. If our hill height was heigher than the initial drop there's mo way the car would make it over. The car wouldn't have energy to make it over a hill heigher than the initial drop because since energy cannot be created the amount of energy you have from the initial drop will stay the for the hill. you can't create more energy to get over a higher hill.
