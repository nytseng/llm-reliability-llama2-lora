We have the great rollar coaster called Hoppolia! This is Icelandic for jumping in puddlies.We will have an elevator for people to get to the top. This will be efficient, because many people can fit on one elevator. Elevators are also very safe, because people can’t fall out and they have good speed. To spice the elevator up we can decorate it very creepy + have scary music play!Initial drop: To make sure our coaster can be fast we have the drop at 97 meters. It won’t take a lot of energy. The hight is good, because there will be gravity forces pushing down on people to keep them in there car. People will love this part not just for the stomach flip felling, but also the high speed! This rollar coaster will go about 30 m/s^2.loop: The loop is always everyone’s favorite part! This loop will be like no other! It will be so much fun no one know what hit them! There will be some room between the initial drop + the loop to slow things down. By the time it hits the loop it will be totally epic! This part will be coast cost effective because it is less expensive to buy. The loop diamiter will be 35 meters.hill: My hill is ment to give the riders that last stomach drop give the coaster the energy it needs to end the ride. The hight of the hill hight will be 27 meters high. This hight will be best to push it to the end + to make it fun! This is not to fast but fast enough. The car will still be going fairly fast from the loop, so rides can look forward to the fast hill too!At the end of the coaster, there will be water to stop in! No one will be expecting it, so its a nice surprise at the end! It won’t be like they drop into a tank of water, it’s just like a push to slow it down.  This is a good way to stop, because water will make it stop sooner!We hope you like your perpocil!,.'",

The hill gives the rollercoaster car will enough potential energy. My rollercoaster blueprint might be a perfect idea because it has the right amount of mass, the right hill height, the right hill which is gradual and the correct measurement of the initial drop.

After the initial drop the car moves into the .4 meter loop height. As the car goes up the loop and up the hill, the potential energy is increasing. As it is going down the initial drop, comes out of the loop, and goes down the hill, the kinetic energy was increasing.We noticed that as height would increase the energy  gained. At the base, there is only kinetic energy due to the potential energy being converted to kinetic energy. But at the top of the hill, there is replenished potential energy to use.'",

A lot of kinetic energy means a lot of motion, which is why our initial drop starts a fun ride. The .77m of potential energy turns into kinetic energy and heat energy.After the initial drop comes our hill and loop. We chose to make our hill height .5m high. In my simulation, I tested different hill heights. I found out that if the height is the same or higher than the initial drop height, than the car will not move it over the hill. Therefore, .5m was the perfect height and at the end of the hill It’s potential energy then became 0. '",

Please say Yes if it defines the concept at the input correctly, otherwise say No. Here is the student paragraph: 'Our group decided to lift our car to a height of 0.9 meters using a conveyor belt method. We chose this mass because more mass means more potential energy. This can be proven by the formula for potential energy which is 9.8 x mass x height. This is also why we chose to have a high initial drop height. The reason we want more potential energy is because of the Law of Conservation of Energy. This states that energy can’t be created or destroyed in a system. We didn’t want our mass to be too heavy. Initial Drop The initial drop height is 0.9 meters, a high height to increase the potential energy. Kinetic energy is velocity^2x1/2xmass. So, if mass stays constant and kinetic energy increases, velocity must increase. We get this kinetic energy because potential energy turns into kinetic energy. But, since our roller coaster does not have friction all potential energy turns into kinetic, making it faster. Hill/loopWe chose a hill height of 0.5 meters. We chose this height because the hill can’t be taller than the initial drop according to the Law of Conservation of Energy.'",

Because of this law that extra .1 J of energy turns into heat energy because it cannot just disappear. The hill height is 7.5 m. The hill height must be less than the initial drop height or else there will not be enough energy built up to get the car over the hill.

Please say Yes if it defines the concept at the input correctly, otherwise say No. Here is the student paragraph: '0.4 kg. would be the best amount for car mass. To start off with, 0.4 kg would be the best mass for the car because, since the car is lighter than .8 kg. Also, since the initial drop height isn’t too high, you don’t have to decrease the mass anymore. Also, the car is 0.4 kg, which is heavier than 0.2 kg. So at the top of the initial drop, the car will have 3.9 J for the initial potential energy instead of only 2 J. Mass does not affect speed so this doesn’t play a role. 0.4 kg for the car mass doesn’t take as much energy as heavier car masses. And the increased car mass increases KE( the energy of motion), so the car will go fast and create a thrilling experience.One meter would be the best height for the initial drop. First of all, the increased height increases potential energy. So the potential energy at the top of the initial drop with a height of 1m would be 9.8 J. This amount of PE is greater than the .2m height, the .4m height, the .6m height, and the .8m height. The potential energy for those heights were 2 J, 3.9 J, 5.9 J, and 7.8 J. Also, the KE at the bottom of the drop was increased also for 1 m as the height. The KE was 9.8 J. This amount of KE is greater than the other heights. The KE at the bottom of those hill heights was only 2 J, 3.9 J, 5.9 J, and 7.9 J. Lastly, the Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed but can be transfered to different dorms. This relates to the initial drop height because the height needs to be tall enough so the car has enough energy to go over the hill. If the initial drop height was increased any more, the car would go to fast.0.5 m would be the best height for the hill. One reason this height is the best is because 0.5 m is not tall than the initial drop height (1m) so the car has enough energy (about 4 J) to make it over the hill. If the hill was taller, say, 1m, and the initial drop was also 1m, than the car wouldn’t be able to make it over the hill. This also is related to Law of Conservation of Energy because energy cannot be created in the car to go over the hill. The initial drop builds up energy in the car, but if the car doesn’t have enough energy, it cannot be created.'",
