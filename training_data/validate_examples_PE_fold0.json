It will be where all of the energy must be created in the form of Potential energy. A height of 90m would be just right because the initial drop can help the car to go over the hills with enough potential energy. I propose that we should make the roller coasters drop 90 meters tall because the roller coaster needs a lot of KE to go through the rest of the roller coaster. During initial drop, the increasing height increases potential energy at the top of hill and kinetic energy at the bottom of hill. When we increase the initial drop height the car has a faster speed so it'll be able to travel farther.The hill of the roller coaster is another critical part. It must be a smaller height than the initial drop to have enough energy to go up the hill. The hill can be .80 meter or less because it can’t be more than .89 meter because the potential energy would be transformed to kinetic energy with the loss of heat.  The hill has this height, the car will have enough Kinetic energy to get it over the hill. When increasing height and mass in car lift, potential energy increased.'",

Please say Yes if it defines the concept at the input correctly, otherwise say No. Here is the student paragraph: 'When the initial height increases the PE will increase and the KE increases. If you increase the car mass then the amount of Potential energy and kinetic energy will also increase. We choose the drop height to be .8m because then it will have enough energy to go over .7m hill and a loop with a radius .2m. The greater the drop height the greater the PE, and KE. When the height was .2m there was .8J of PE at the top but there we increased the height to .4m the PE at the top was 1.6 J. We choose this drop height because the greater the drop height the greater PE and KE. When we choose .8 meters to be our drop height to make it fun but also safe. When we did .8 m in the simulation with a mass of .4kg it didn’t go over 40 m/s/s. Because the law of conversation of energy says that energy cannot be created or destroyed we had to choose appropriate drop height to get it over the hills and around the loop. When the car goes down the drop the Potiental energy is changed to KE because PE= m*h*9.8 and KE=m*1/2*v^2. As the hill height increases PE, KE increases. The hill height is higher than the initial drop then it will not have enough energy to make it over the hill. If you increase the hill height the PE increases at the top and so does the KE at the bottom. We choose a hill height of .7m because our drop height was .8m. There would only be KE at the bottom of the rollarcoaster because KE = m*1/2 *v.^2 and it has nothing to do with height but PE = m*h*. 9.8 so that is why PE i effected by height.'",

Please say Yes if it defines the concept at the input correctly, otherwise say No. Here is the student paragraph: 'Our group decided to lift our car to a height of 0.9 meters using a conveyor belt method. We chose this mass because more mass means more potential energy. This can be proven by the formula for potential energy which is 9.8 x mass x height. This is also why we chose to have a high initial drop height. The reason we want more potential energy is because of the Law of Conservation of Energy. This states that energy can’t be created or destroyed in a system. We didn’t want our mass to be too heavy. Initial Drop The initial drop height is 0.9 meters, a high height to increase the potential energy. Kinetic energy is velocity^2x1/2xmass. So, if mass stays constant and kinetic energy increases, velocity must increase. We get this kinetic energy because potential energy turns into kinetic energy. But, since our roller coaster does not have friction all potential energy turns into kinetic, making it faster. Hill/loopWe chose a hill height of 0.5 meters. We chose this height because the hill can’t be taller than the initial drop according to the Law of Conservation of Energy.'",

When mass was .2kg the Potential energy at the top was 2J, and then we increased the mass to .4kg the potential energy increased to 3.9J. The mass of .74kg isn't too high to be unsafe because if Potential energy was too high the car would go down the hill with too much force.

They increased by 2J every time the height went up by .2m. The total energy is the Potential energy plus the Kinetic energy, so that also increased. Potential energy is highest at the top of the drop because it's energy at rest. Kinetic energy is highest at the bottom because it's energy at motion. Energy can't be created or destroyed but can change it's form. The third thing the team decided on was the hill height. We chose a height of .62m.

If our hill height was heigher than the initial drop there's mo way the car would make it over.
