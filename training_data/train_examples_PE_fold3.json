The initial hill height that I choose was 45 meters because we wanted it to be the tallest height as possible so it would have the most potential energy. I choose this height because it will have more potential energy to go all over the rollercoaster. During the initial drop, most of the js of PE will be transforming into K.E.E with the loss of heat. I choose 25 meters hill height because the car would have less kinetic energy when going down hill into the stopping point. We could not make the hill taller than the initial drop because of the Law of Conservation of energy, which says energy cannot be created or destroyed. The hill will be good because they are still using energy from the initial drop. The final part of the Pacific Coaster is the stopping portion, ending in water. Potential energy was tranformed into heat energy, instead of K.E.The car will also have a lot more potential energy than a bigger car with a smaller mass. The car mass that I choose was 25kg. I choose this car mass because it won’t be so difficult to take the car to the top of the initial drop and our car had the greatest mass, so that these was the most potential energy as possible.

We chose a height of .8 meters because it is a large drop that has enough potential energy to go through the entire rollercoaster. While testing to find the best drop height we learned that if you increase the height, the amount of potential energy also increases. We took a height of .2 meters and the potential energy was .6 Joules. Then we took a height of .4 meters and we saw that the potential energy increased to 1.2 Joules. This was how we discovered an increase in height gives you a higher potential energy. When you have friction on the initial drop, the potential energy at the top of the hill will NOT equal the kenetic energy at the bottom of the drop. This is because energy is being lost due to heat energy. This drop is an important part of the rollercoaster.",

A height of 90m would be just right because the initial drop can help the car to go over the hills with enough potential energy. I propose that we should make the roller coasters drop 90 meters tall because the roller coaster needs a lot of KE to go through the rest of the roller coaster. During initial drop, the increasing height increases potential energy at the top of hill and kinetic energy at the bottom of hill. When we increase the initial drop height the car has a faster speed so it'll be able to travel farther.The hill of the roller coaster is another critical part. It must be a smaller height than the initial drop to have enough energy to go up the hill. The hill can be .80 meter or less because it can’t be more than .89 meter because the potential energy would be transformed to kinetic energy with the loss of heat.

If the height of the initial drop is .65 meter, there will be more potential energy. To be exact, in the simulation, the potential energy was 3.9 joules. When the car moves down the drop, the potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy. But, in the real world, some kinetic energy will be lost to heat energy, but the total amount of energy is the same. This is because of the Law of Conservation of Energy. This law states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. Since the mass is small, this also affects the total energy. This is because more mass means more potential energy and kinetic energy.After this is over, we bring them back up a hill of 0.56 meters, just slightly lower than the initial hill. When they first begin dropping, they will feel a thrill. At the top of the hill, they will experience  the feeling of weightlessness. They wont stay up there long before being shot back down the hill, reaching a fast speed. Finally, after traveling a short distance the brakes will be added to the cart and it will come to a stop, which will give the riders one last feeling of force. Despite all these amazing features, we believe that the best aspect of our design is the fact that it is completely frictionless, so after the drop, no more energy needs to be added to the cart, making it very environmental and economical friendly.

There will be some room between the initial drop + the loop to slow things down. By the time it hits the loop it will be totally epic! This part will be coast cost effective because it is less expensive to buy.

The hight of the hill hight will be 27 meters high. This hight will be best to push it to the end + to make it fun! This is not to fast but fast enough. The car will still be going fairly fast from the loop, so rides can look forward to the fast hill too!At the end of the coaster, there will be water to stop in! No one will be expecting it, so its a nice surprise at the end! It won’t be like they drop into a tank of water, it’s just like a push to slow it down.

When we did .8 m in the simulation with a mass of .4kg it didn’t go over 40 m/s/s. Because the law of conversation of energy says that energy cannot be created or destroyed we had to choose appropriate drop height to get it over the hills and around the loop.

The hill height is higher than the initial drop then it will not have enough energy to make it over the hill. If you increase the hill height the PE increases at the top and so does the KE at the bottom. We choose a hill height of .7m because our drop height was .8m.

Another reason we chose a high initial drop height is when height increases, there is an increase in speed. the mass of our car is 50kg. The initial drop is perfect because the amount of Kinetic energy at the bottom isn’t too close to the amount of potential energy at the top.

This happens because the formula for potential energy is mass x height x gravity.

Potential energy can be converted into kenetic energy, which is the amount of energy an object has in motion. Therefore, if you have a lot of potential energy, you will also get a lot of kenetic energy. This also means that if a rollercoaster has no height, it has no potential energy and if the rollercoaster is not moving, it has no kienetic energy. So, before the rollercoaster goes up the initial drop, it has potential energy or kenetic energy. At the top of the initial drop, it has potential energy but not kenetic energy. You can determine how much potential energy the rollercoaster has by using the formula PE=m•g•h (PE=potential energy, m=mass, g=9.8(acceleration due to gravity) and h=height of hill.)

The ride proposed is fun as the big differences in height from the falls make people feel adrenaline therefore, they will feel different but in a good way. Also, it is safe as there are friction controllers on the ride to make the cart slow down whenever it is reaching high points so that it stays on track and safe. The first part of the track is the initial drop, which is a the maximum height. The car at the top is positions to go down the ramp. At this point the potential energy is at its maximum which means that the cart must have not be moving. So, once the cart slides, it goes down the drop. This makes it safer for everyone as it avoids risks of going out of the ride. Then, at the bottom the cart is at its maximum kinetic energy and 0 potential as it is at ground level. Then, there is a hill where the cart reaches a maximum height lower than the previous one. In this part the cart slows down as it reaches the maximum height were its kinetic energy is 0 again.

The reasoning behind our choice of Car Mass is the reasonable amount of Potential Energy (pe). For example, a 0.4 kg mass resulted in 3.9 J of pe. A greater Car Mass of 0.8 kg  resulted in 7.8 J of pe. For all of these trials we used a lift height of 1 meter. We suggest an Initial Drop Height of 1 meter. In our trials as Drop Increased the pe increased. For instance, with a Drop Height of 0.4 meters the Initial PE and final ke were 3.9 J. Equal initial pe and final KE showed the law of conservation of energy. As the hill height increased, the PE increased at the hill top. Our chosen hill height was safer than a lower hill height, because the speed at the top was less. For example, a hill height of 0.6 (m) results in a hill top PE of 2.3 J . The PE of this lower hill is slightly less at 1.2 J. The ke at hill base was also similar due to the lack of friction (3.9J), as was (the) ke at hill top (1.6J).",

Our team decided on a mass of .74kg and a lift height of 1m. We chose that mass because we didn't want it to be too heavy because then it wouldn't be able to make it over the loops. When mass was .2kg the Potential energy at the top was 2J, and then we increased the mass to .4kg the potential energy increased to 3.9J. The mass of .74kg isn't too high to be unsafe because if Potential energy was too high the car would go down the hill with too much force. The next thing we decided on was the initial drop height, and our company chose 1m. Both potential energy, at the top, and kinetic energy, at the bottom, increased with a higher height. They increased by 2J every time the height went up by .2m. The total energy is the Potential energy plus the Kinetic energy, so that also increased. Potential energy is highest at the top of the drop because it's energy at rest. Kinetic energy is highest at the bottom because it's energy at motion. Energy can't be created or destroyed but can change it's form. The third thing the team decided on was the hill height. We chose a height of .62m. We wanted to make it high for more fun, but if it was any heigher the car wouldn't have enough energy to make it over. If our hill height was heigher than the initial drop there's mo way the car would make it over. The car wouldn't have energy to make it over a hill heigher than the initial drop because since energy cannot be created the amount of energy you have from the initial drop will stay the for the hill. you can't create more energy to get over a higher hill.",

Because the law of conversation of energy says that energy can not be created or destroyed, we had to choose a aporiate drop height to get it over the hills.

We chose this height because it caused the car to have a lot of potential energy, which is measured in joules. I also knew that when you increase the drop height, you increase the potential energy, which increases the kinetic energy at the end of the drop. A lot of kinetic energy means a lot of motion. The .77m of potential energy turns into kinetic energy and heat energy. The speed increases when your going down the drop. The car gains speed.         After the initial drop comes our hill. We chose to make our hill height .5m high. In my simulation, I tested different hill heights. I found out that if the height is the same or higher than the initial drop height, than the car will not move it over the hill. Therefore, .5m was the perfect height for the car rolls over.

To start off with, 0.4 kg would be the best mass for the car because, since the car is lighter than .8 kg. Also, since the initial drop height isn’t too high, you don’t have to decrease the mass anymore. Also, the car is 0.4 kg, which is heavier than 0.2 kg. So at the top of the initial drop, the car will have 3.9 J for the initial potential energy instead of only 2 J. Mass does not affect speed so this doesn’t play a role. 0.4 kg for the car mass doesn’t take as much energy as heavier car masses. And the increased car mass increases KE( the energy of motion), so the car will go fast and create a thrilling experience.One meter would be the best height for the initial drop. First of all, the increased height increases potential energy. So the potential energy at the top of the initial drop with a height of 1m would be 9.8 J. This amount of PE is greater than the .2m height, the .4m height, the .6m height, and the .8m height. The potential energy for those heights were 2 J, 3.9 J, 5.9 J, and 7.8 J. Also, the KE at the bottom of the drop was increased also for 1 m as the height. The KE was 9.8 J. This amount of KE is greater than the other heights. The KE at the bottom of those hill heights was only 2 J, 3.9 J, 5.9 J, and 7.9 J. Lastly, the Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed but can be transfered to different dorms. This relates to the initial drop height because the height needs to be tall enough so the car has enough energy to go over the hill. If the initial drop height was increased any more, the car would go to fast.0.5 m would be the best height for the hill. One reason this height is the best is because 0.5 m is not tall than the initial drop height (1m) so the car has enough energy (about 4 J) to make it over the hill. If the hill was taller, say, 1m, and the initial drop was also 1m, than the car wouldn’t be able to make it over the hill. This also is related to Law of Conservation of Energy because energy cannot be created in the car to go over the hill.

The mass chosen was 0.5 kg because it has a good amount of potential energy (P.E.) at 3.9 J which is created by going up the lift height of 0.8m which gives enough time for an amount of energy that will carry the car over the lift. We found greater mass means more energy.         The initial drop height (I.D.) chosen was 0.8 m. The company chose this height because it is high enough to reach a  good amount of P.E. at 3.9 J which will create a speed to go over the track, but with the kinetic energy of 3.9 J, that the P.E. from the drop  transferred into, the riders are safe from going off track. Unlike the height of 0.6m which only has a potential energy of 2.9 J, it has more potential energy when it is higher.        The hill height chosen was 0.43 m. We chose this because it coincides well. Since an object in motion stays in motion, the car won’t change speed going over the hill and could easily stop or fly off track which this height prevents. Also if the hill is too high the car won’t make it over. ",

We chose that mass because we didn't want it to be too heavy because then it wouldn't be able to make it over the loops. When mass was .2kg the Potential energy at the top was 2J, and then we increased the mass to .4kg the potential energy increased to 3.9J. The mass of .74kg isn't too high to be unsafe because if Potential energy was too high the car would go down the hill. When the lift height increased by .2m the potential energy increased at the same rate as it did for mass. There will not be an increase in speed, even if mass increases because speed increases with an increase in drop height. With a mass of .74kg and a height of 1m the car will be able to make it over a surface with friction.         The next thing we decided on was the initial drop height, and our company chose 1m. With a higher height the car will go faster. Both potential energy, at the top, and kinetic energy, at the bottom, increased with a higher height. They increased by 2J every time the height went up by .2m. The total energy is the Potential energy plus the Kinetic energy, so that also increased. Potential energy is highest at the top of the drop because it's energy at rest. Kinetic energy is highest at the bottom because it's energy at motion. Energy can't be created or destroyed but can change it's form. When there's friction it creates heat so if there was Friction on the drop then potential energy would stay the same since friction doesn't affect it. Friction would decrease Kinetic energy.         The third thing the team decided on was the hill height. We chose a height of .62m. We wanted to make it high for more fun, but if it was any heigher the car wouldn't have enough energy to make it over. If our hill height was heigher than the initial drop there's mo way the car would make it over. The car wouldn't have energy to make it over a hill heigher than the initial drop because since energy cannot be created the amount of energy you have from the initial drop will stay the for the hill. you can't create more energy to get over a higher hill.

Our height and mass of the car .5kg sets the amount of PE for the rest of our track which is 2.9 joules. The more height and mass there is, the more potential energy at the top and kinetic energy at the bottom.        Our Initial Drop height we chose was .8m.Our initial drop starting out with 2.9 joules of potential energy waiting to turn into kinetic energy. As you go down you lose some of the kinetic energy to heat energy. On our next part we have a gradual hill. 2 joules of potential energy to use at the top. We choose a height of .43m because when we tried to make a hill higher than the initial drop, there was not enough energy for the car to make it over.",

The amount of potential energy is 7.3J. This is on the higher end for potential energy, which gives it enough speed to get over the hill. The amount of kinetic energy is 7.3J.         Then for the initial drop height, it was chosen to be 1m. This height gave a higher speed compared to a lower height. It also has more potential energy and kinetic energy compared to a lower height.        When choosing the hill height, the final height ended up as .62m.In the hands on experiments. If we made the hill taller than .62m, and it was higher than the drop, the car would not have enough energy to make it over the hill. ",

It seems to go over every hill that we choose. If we increased to .5kg or decreased it to .3kg, it wouldn’t go over the hill or have to much acceleration go down the hill. he initial drop is the most important part of the roller coaster, because that’s were the car is going to start it’s adventure and where P.E. is starting. My group chose .75m for the Initial drop height. We chose .75m because if the height of the initial drop was small, such as .40m then it might not have enough energy. My group chose our hill height to be .60m. We put our hill height at .60m because then one the way down the hill, the car get’s enough energy and speed to get up the next hill. ",

The car mass we choose for the car is 0.6 kg. , and potential energy is 1.2J, so that means the roller coaster will work more efficiently. We wanted to have a higher mass and intial drop height because that makes more potential energy for the ride based on the formula. For our initial drop height, we put it at 1m. Potential energy is the amount of stored energy you have for the rest of the ride. The height we choose is very high so the car gets a lot of K.E. It helps the car get really fast at the beginning to go over the .6 m hill height. So when the height of the hill increases the amount of P.E. decreases by .72. Our hill height was put at .60m. The more mass you have on a car, the more speed you will have going down the hill. The P.E. at the top .8J and the K.E. at top is .8 J which means K.E. At base 1.6 J. ",
