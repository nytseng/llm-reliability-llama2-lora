The more potential energy you have, the more energy you will have for the rest of the ride, which was our goal. In the initial drop, we took the Potential Energy and transformed it to Kinetic Energy. At the top, there is no Kinetic Energy because all the Potential Energy has yet to transform into Kinetic Energy. The higher the initial drop height got, the more potential energy you had.  Also, all the potential energy had transformed into Kinetic energy. Also, when the mass went up, so did the potential energy. This means, the more mass you have, the more potential energy you will have. Also, mass doesn’t affect speed.The Hill It has a height of 0.42m. to give the thrill to the people, by slowing down the ride while going up, and speeding it back up when it goes down. The principle involved is again the energy principle, as kinetic energy is partially converted into potential energy while going up and then this potential energy is again converted into kinetic energy.

This roller coaster is the best. Tostart the roller coaster is the initial drop. It will be using a cart that is 5 grams, so their is enough mass to keep the car on track. Right at the top of the initial drop it will hold the cart just so it is at al most 80º Then hold it for 3 to 5 second to make it more intresting The Force used to pull the cart from the bottom to the Top will have to be big enough so it can pull it all the way back threw the track so people can rid it again        The inetial drop like I said the height is .77 meters high Then it will hold at The top for 3 to 5 seconds When it drops it will lossen the pully lines so it will feel like you’r falling  out of the The sky. Whem the cart is droped it will still stay in contact with the track so it does not go off the track and not make it safe at the Bottom it will be a gradual ride to a flat section.         On the hill the hill will not have way to much presure on the people on the ride so they would get supper hurt or even die. the hills height will be .5 meters high and have it be in like a black hole leading up to it then fly down the other side of the hill Then Their will be a slight flat section going to the loop.         Right when you get to the loop Their will be the track that has the end of the loop where you go from when you start To get on the loop and then when you get off the loop it will kinda be like a train changing lanes to go a different direction. The loop height will be .24 meters in height and diamiter ad when it gets to the loop it will have enough volocity To keep it from getting stuck at the top then falling out then not making it safe.         When The cart is don with the loop the caret will be stoping in ashort amount of timeThe amount of energy will be all taken away when it comes to the landing strip and that will be a section  When They get to a complete stop The cart will go back to the begaing but fast.

When increasing height, potential Energy will increase too because of the formula, mass•height•gravity=Potential Energy. So increasing any one of those variables will cause the possible energy, Potential, to increase. Same with decreasing also with changing of height speed will change as well. Once you go down the initial drop you will go over the hill of .5m. Lastly, is the car stopping point. It stoped because there wasn’t enough energy to get over the hill. This is because of the conservation of energy, energy cant be created not destroyed.'",

Please say Yes if it defines the concept at the input correctly, otherwise say No. Here is the student paragraph: 'I have recently designed a rollercoaster for your park to benefit your visitors. It involves a drop and a hill. For the mass of the cart,  I chose the mass of the cart to be 0.5 kg so it would not be too massive to prevent passengers from riding, but not to light to the point where the cart travels too fast the flies off the track. The beginning part of the coaster consists of a track at the top of an initial drop. The cart reaches the top- a safe height that also allows for fast speeds. The higher the cart is placed, the more potential energy is has that can be transformed into kinetic energy which makes the cart travel faster. This height is large enough for a very fast speed but is still safe for the riders. As the car drops, all of the cart’s potential energy turns into kinetic energy that speeds up the cart. The cart goes down the track making it one of the more exciting parts of the ride. The third part of the track involves a curve and a hill, which is 0.4 m high, the cart climbs and then goes over. This part of the track is frictionless so the cart can move faster without being slowed down. This allows the kinetic energy of the cart coming down the initial drop to be transformed into potential energy as the cart climbs the hill. This gained potential energy will immediately be turned into kinetic energy as the cart slides back down the final hill, increasing the speed of the cart, and making it a fun, fast-paced ride. No friction could be a concern because the cart could go to fast This is compensated by the height of the hill. As the hill gets higher, the chances of the cart reaching these dangerous speeds would be less. To implement this coaster in your amusement park, a large scale-up would be needed to create this simulation on a real, much larger scale. '",

Car mass:  My corporation decided to use 0.5kg for the mass of the car. This is why. When the car mass increased, potential energy increased. When the car mass [0.4kg] increased, the potential energy was 3.9J. When my corporation changed the car mass to 0.8, we found out that the was potential energy was 7.8J. My corporation decided to use 0.5kg because, we didn’t want it to be 0.8kg because it would be harder to get it up the hill. The initial drop provides the kinetic energy 100%, required to get the car over the hill, and to the gate. Its one meter tall, so having a tall height means more potential energy at the top. The total energy was 4.9 Joules. Having more energy means you can have more to the rollercoaster because it has more energy to lose.The initial drop is fun because of the high height. The height of the hill is .18meters. The hill is near the end of the ride, so at the top of the hill the potential energy is only 1 joule.'",

Please say Yes if it defines the concept at the input correctly, otherwise say No. Here is the student paragraph: 'We decided to make the car be lifted up 90m. The car of this height will have a good amount of potential energy. If the height of the initial drop increases, then the speed of the car will be greater. The car lift is efficient because here mass of our car is 50kg which means that the potential energy  is high. The potential and kinetic energy increases as mass increases. For the initial drop, the amount of Kinetic energy at the bottom is close to the amount of potential energy at the top. The potential energy that doesn’t change into kinetic energy turns into heat energy. This happens because our roller coaster has friction. As the height of the initial drop or the mass of the car raises the potential energy raises too. The next part to our rollercoasters is the hill. The height we chose for the hill was 50m tall. The final part of our roller coaster is the stopping section. The car comes into the stopping section with a relatively high speed.'",

That is fixed by the height of the drop. Mass doen’t affect speed no matter what height.  Our firm chose the hill height to be .55 m because it slows down the car enough but still keep the speed high enough. The mass being heavier (.2kg, .4kg, .6kg) doesn’t affect the distance in the stop area. The I.D. height does though.

The reasoning behind our choice of Car Mass is the reasonable amount of Potential Energy (pe). The more mass the more PE. For example, a 0.4 kg mass resulted in 3.9 J of pe. A greater Car Mass of 0.8 kg resulted in 7.8 J of pe. Compared to the lowest Car Mass of 0.2 kg with the pe 2 J, our chosen car mass had a greater of 3.9 J.It won’t fly off the tracks like the decreased mass.Next we will discuss the Initial Drop Height. We suggest an Initial Drop Height of 1 meter. In our trials as Drop Increased the pe increased as well as speed. For instance, with a Drop Height of 0.4 meters the Initial PE and final ke were 3.9 J. When drop height was doubled to 0.8 meters, initial PE and final yes were 7.8 J. Equal initial pe and final KE showed the law of conservation of energy. The final speed did not change with different car masses. Hill Height will be discussed next. We suggest using the Hill height of 0.5 (m). As the hill height increased, the PE increased at the hill top. The speed at the hill top decreased with greater hill height. For example, a hill height of 0.6 (m) results in a hill top PE of 2.3 J. The PE of this lower hill is slightly less at 1.2 J'",

Please say Yes if it defines the concept at the input correctly, otherwise say No. Here is the student paragraph: 'To start off with, our firm chose .6kg as a car mass. One of the reasons is that during the experiments, 2 kg as a car mass reached 2 J for potential energy,.4 kg had 3.9 J for potential energy & .8 had 7.8 J as a potential energy, so for an extra experiment, the car mass of .6 had reached 5.9 J , and 5.9 J seemed to be the perfect number, as the level would be high enough to make it up the hill, and not to take up more money for more track, because it takes P.E. to make it up the hill, as potential energy goes down, kinetic energy goes up, as kinetic energy is the energy of a moving object, an potential energy is the energy an object something potentially has, and since, as the law of conservation proves, since energy cannot be created, nor destroyed, only transferred, P.E. is transferred to become K.E. and with not friction, like in the simulation, k.E. and P.E. would be equal, but adding friction, like in the real life experiments, P.E. and K.K. will be different, so as some of the K.E. is ‘lost’ shall we say, (Not literally, as I said that energy cannot be destroyed, nor created) then it’ll take more P.E. to make it up the hill, but not so much as to have to add more track for it to stop, because adding more track is costly.        The firm chose for the initial drop height to be .8 m, and here’s why. You see, two things can affect the P.E. needed for it to make it up the hill, the car mass, and the lift height. Now, the initial drop affects the P.E. about the same as car mass does, for example, 0.2m=2J, 0.4m=3.9J, 0.6m=5.9J, and 0.8m=7.8J. Did you notice a pattern? It’s the same for mass except it’s kg instead of m, so basically, initial drop affects P.E. just as much as car mass does, but when both are considered, they can create a bigger number, after all, 5+5 is 10, not 5. Anyways, we chose 0.8 as an initial drop, (Let’s label it I.D from now one.) because, it’ll give us enough P.E to make it over the hill, like with the car, plus, in this, we kept and eye on speed, mostly because mass has no effect on speed so we didn’t mention that ; but height affects speed and a high level of speed can be dangerous. For the hill, the firm chose the height to be .6 m as it allowed the car to go over the hill.'",
